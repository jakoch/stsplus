INTRODUCTION
------------

     Program STSORBIT PLUS is an enhanced version of STSORBIT, my original 
orbital tracking and display program. As a general rule, a 386 or better 
IBM-compatible computer is required, 486 or better recommended. A math 
coprocessor chip is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED and will dramatically improve 
performance; the math coprocessor chip is REQUIRED for acceptable 
performance when using the orthographic projection. While the program will 
execute with slower processors, performance is unacceptably slow. See the 
section HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS for additional information and discussion. 
The program is intended for use during Space Shuttle missions and for 
general satellite tracking using NASA/NORAD 2-Line Orbital Elements 
("TLEs"). One primary satellite and up to 48 additional "static" or "real 
time" satellites may be simultaneously tracked in real time on most 
computers. Both orthographic and rectangular map projections are available, 
displaying the Earth as a globe or the more traditional "flat map". Tabular 
line-of-sight and visible satellite pass predictions may be made from 
within STSORBIT PLUS and passes of interest may be easily displayed. Using 
the companion program GPSSYNC, the computer clock may be sunchronized to 
GPS time (to an accuracy of a second or two) and the current position 
(latitude, longitude, and elevation) may be determined using a connected 
GPS receiver. (The current release of GPSSYNC supports DeLorme and Garmin 
GPS receivers; other receivers may be supported in future releases.)

                        **************************
                        *  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE  *
                        **************************

     STSPLUS has been subjected to a final round of Y2K testing to ensure 
     compliance with Year 2000. No Y2K problems are known as of Version 
     9848. STSPLUS supports 2-digit year entries: entries from 50 to 99 
     will be assigned to century 1900 and entries from 00 to 49 will be 
     assigned to century 2000. Note that these tests only verified that 
     STSPLUS executes correctly at and after the transition to Year 2000, 
     not that a particular computer and its clock will make the transition 
     correctly. Older computers may have BIOS or other systemic problems in 
     hardware and/or software which may prevent proper operation at or 
     after Year 2000 independent of the operation of STSPLUS.

     STSORBIT PLUS is very accurate when used with current (and accurate) 
2-line elements. The program has been qualified by the USAF and meets the 
requirement of placing a satellite within 0.5 km over a 24-hour time span 
from the epoch time of the 2-line elements. It is used daily at the USAF 
Central Computer Complex at Cape Canaveral, by the DOD C-Band Radar Network 
at their worldwide radar sites, and at half a dozen NASA and aerospace 
control centers around the country. Astronaut training programs at NASA, 
ESA, and RSA also use STSORBIT PLUS. ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter took 
STSPLUS on the Mir Space Station for six months in 1995/96. The program is 
made available to schools through NASA Spacelink and the NASA Teacher 
Resource Centers. Numerous schools and amateur radio enthusiasts have made 
contact with the space shuttle and Mir space station via amateur radio Šwhile using STSORBIT PLUS.
     STSORBIT PLUS is copyrighted software; you are hereby granted a non-
exclusive license for non-commercial or educational use only. Agencies of 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 2


the U.S. Government are also hereby granted a non-exclusive license for 
internal use. Use STSORBIT PLUS if you like it, discard it if you don't. 
There are no warranties of any kind. If you wish to use STSORBIT PLUS 
commercially, write for license information. The only request I make of 
users is that they take the time to complete and return the confidential 
questionnaire in file README. The questionnaire gives users a chance to 
offer comments and suggestions, and lets me know that people use and 
appreciate STSORBIT PLUS. Registration of STSORBIT PLUS is inexpensive and 
optional -- but will be appreciated and will encourage me to continue 
supporting and enhancing the program. Additional higher detail map database 
files are available to registered users by mail (see file README).
     STSORBIT PLUS (which I will usually refer to as STSPLUS from here on) 
is intended to display the position and ground track of an orbiting 
satellite on a selection of maps ranging from a full map of the world to 
zoom maps showing considerable detail. The program has special features 
implemented at the request of NASA astronauts and others for use during a 
NASA Space Shuttle mission. With the appropriate 2-line elements, STSPLUS 
displays the position and ground track of a variety of satellites such as 
the Space Shuttle, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Gamma Ray Observatory, 
or the Russian MIR Space Station. Accurate TDRS coverage, including times 
for acquisition and loss of signal, is calculated for satellites which use 
that satellite network for communications. Special Location and Tracking 
Station displays show concentric isocontours, circles of equal satellite 
altitude; these special maps can be especially valuable for visual or 
amateur radio sightings.

     The initial premise for STSORBIT was to attempt to duplicate the wall 
map in NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas. Before I started 
this project, I had seen several other programs which tracked satellites 
but each fell short of my map and display objectives for one reason or 
another. I therefore set out to do the job myself. STSORBIT, my initial 
effort, and now STSORBIT PLUS, have been the result. Since then other 
programs have appeared which produce similar information, most notably Paul 
Traufler's excellent TRAKSAT (which was inspired by STSORBIT). It may be, 
of course, that others will judge this effort lacking for some tasks, but 
no one program can do everything. One problem is that of screen size and 
resolution: the wall map at Mission Control Center is some twenty feet wide 
with an impressive pixel resolution, very different from the typical 
personal computer monitor. The NASA wall map shows essentially the entire 
globe in a cylindrical projection; STSORBIT also used a cylindrical 
projection and restricted the vertical display to latitudes from +85 
degrees to -85 degrees in order to achieve reasonable proportions and 
vertical resolution while at the same time showing recognizable land 
features. STSORBIT PLUS now presents the Earth as a globe using an 
orthographic projection with zoom while still retaining the original 
cylindrical (rectangular) projection. STSPLUS adds many additional features 
and improved accuracy over the original STSORBIT.
     Initially, and as a consequence of a lack of accurate orbital data for 
Space Shuttle missions while they were in progress, I did not try to be 
especially precise with respect to the orbital mathematics. Additionally, 
mathematical complexity had to be held to a reasonable minimum if older 
computers not equipped with a math coprocessor were to be able to maintain Šthe presentation in real time. My somewhat casual attitude toward 
mathematical precision changed with the launch of the Hubble Space 
Telescope (HST) and the regular availability of US Space Command 2-Line 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 3


Elements via modem from Dr. TS Kelso's Celestial BBS. Until HST, I had been 
content to manually adjust the orbital data occasionally during the course 
of a typical five day mission and live with the errors inherent in my 
original simple orbital model. The accuracy of that model degraded rapidly 
after five or ten orbits and, although it could be adjusted from time to 
time during a mission, more accurate data are now readily available prior 
to and during a mission. NASA SpaceLink in Huntsville, Alabama began 
posting 2-line orbital elements for the Space Shuttle in early 1991 due in 
part to my persistent and continuing requests; Bill Anderson, Jeff Ehmen, 
and Jeff Cobb, sysops of the SpaceLink system, are continually upgrading 
the services available.
     Beginning in mid-1990, therefore, STSORBIT was extensively modified to 
read orbital data from these USSPACECOM 2-line elements and thereby 
maintain significantly improved accuracy over long periods of time. As an 
incidental benefit, the ground tracks of other satellites (such as the 
Russian space station MIR) could also be displayed. At present, the orbital 
model (SGP4) used with 2-line elements is accurate only for low Earth 
orbits. Deep space orbits, defined as orbits having an orbital period 
greater than or equal to 225 minutes, require a more complex orbital model 
(SDP4) which takes into account solar and lunar perturbations for best 
accuracy. STSPLUS calculates data and displays a ground track for deep 
space objects but the accuracy of these data at times distant from epoch 
has not been validated; it is believed to be "reasonably" accurate. I plan 
to add the SDP4 orbital model to STSPLUS in a future release when time 
permits.
     At about the same time, STSORBIT also found its way to the NASA 
Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Quite a few individuals from JSC 
sent me comments and suggestions for further improving the program, among 
them Ron Parise of the STS-35/ASTRO-1 crew. Ron suggested that I make 
modifications to allow the display of Mission Elapsed Time (MET) for 
shuttle missions while using the USSPACECOM 2-line elements. This would 
allow both the higher accuracy of the USSPACECOM 2-line orbital data and 
permit following the mission timeline using MET. Since launch time and date 
are not included in the 2-line elements but are required to compute MET, 
these data must be entered independently. Another suggestion from Ron and 
others was to include the Sun, solar terminator (calculated at Mean Sea 
Level), and spacecraft lighting conditions to determine if the spacecraft 
is visible.
     Not satisfied with the somewhat rough map used with STSORBIT (a 
digitized EGA world map), I upgraded the maps to use a modified version of 
the World Data Base II. This had the desired effect, to the point where 
rivers and other landmarks could easily be recognized on the monitor and on 
downlinked orbiter television. As a side effect, however, the processor 
overhead increased dramatically -- some slower computers not equipped with 
a math coprocessor were unable to keep up. I therefore essentially "froze" 
the original STSORBIT program (except for minor updates) and created this 
new program, STSORBIT PLUS, intended for the faster, more capable 
processors. Since mid-1991, STSPLUS has spread around the world.
     In addition to NASA and individual users, STSPLUS is also being used 
in an educational setting. As many as 1100 high schools participated in the 
Inspire Project, a VLF propagation test flown on STS-45 and for which 
STSPLUS was one of the recommended tools. At a middle school in Kansas, the Šprogram is projected in the school auditorium from time to time during a 
mission to show the children graphically what is happening and to give them 
a sense of "real time" participation in our space program. At an Air Force 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 4


training facility, STSORBIT is one of many tools used to prepare Air Force 
officers for their duties in the Air Force Space Command. The program was 
widely distributed at a recent National Association of Science Teachers 
convention and by radio amateurs at regional "ham fests".
     STSPLUS is the software used by the NASA/Lewis Telescience Support 
Center in Cleveland, Ohio to display the ground track of the Space Shuttle 
during supported missions. The Canadian Space Agency used STSPLUS as part 
of their briefing of government officials during the STS-52 mission in 
October, 1992. Intelsat used STSPLUS operationally in May of 1992 at their 
Launch Control Center in Washington, DC, and at five tracking stations 
around the world during the exciting STS-49 mission, the maiden flight of 
Endeavour and the rescue/reboost of the INTELSAT-VI satellite. Intelsat was 
kind enough to send me a letter saying that STSORBIT PLUS was "critical to 
mission success"! Numerous other official and semi-official installations 
use STSPLUS as the primary satellite tracking software or to supplement 
other software.

     A brief biographical note: I am a retired physicist and engineer who 
spent all of his professional life in the world of electronics, data 
communications and, more recently, computers. As a young man I was actively 
involved in the early American space program including projects such as 
Ranger, Mariner, Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. Exciting times indeed! I 
spent considerable time at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the early 
1960's as a contractor on Ranger and Mariner; my respect and admiration for 
JPL and its people has, if possible, increased over the intervening 
decades. My interest in space has continued to this day. The desire to 
"keep in touch" with our Space Shuttle missions was one of the incentives 
in the development of this software. I continue to be astonished that a 
relatively inexpensive personal computer is sufficient to perform 
calculations that pushed the limits of our best mainframe computers only a 
decade or so ago. If STSORBIT PLUS also serves to help spark the interest 
of young people in science and technology or can be a learning tool at any 
level, I will have more than achieved my goals.

     No discussion of satellite tracking would be complete without thanks 
to Dr. T. S. Kelso, Col. USAF, who almost single handedly brought satellite 
tracking within the reach of "ordinary folks". TS's Celestial BBS began 
providing unclassified 2-line orbital elements direct from US Space Command 
(formerly NORAD, the North American Air Defense Command) at Cheyenne 
Mountain, Colorado, in 1986. For many years, Celestial BBS was the only 
publicly available electronic source for orbital elements in the world. TS 
has also written a variety of satellite tracking software and his program 
TRAKSTAR may be used directly from within STSPLUS to generate tabular data 
on upcoming satellite passes. In March, 1996, after almost ten years of 
continuous operation, TS shut down Celestial BBS and began posting his data 
on the Internet at his own Home Page.
     Special thanks to Paul Traufler for his friendship and encouragement. 
Our regular telephone conversations have generated many a new idea and the 
synergism has been beneficial to us both. Our two programs, STSPLUS and 
TRAKSAT, have engaged us in a friendly rivalry which has, I think, improved 
both programs many fold. I may have provided the initial spur to Paul to 
write TRAKSAT (in order to improve on my "sloppy orbital math", as Paul Šdescribed it) but TRAKSAT has in turn kept my nose to the grindstone and is 
recognized by many as a standard against which other satellite tracking 
programs are judged. The emphasis of the two programs is slightly 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 5


different, with STSPLUS concentrating on the graphical display and TRAKSAT 
on high precision analytical and predictive techniques. I highly recommend 
TRAKSAT for the serious satellite tracker. My thanks as well for Paul's 
help in upgrading STSORBIT and STSPLUS to use the USSPACECOM 2-Line 
Elements as well as other technical assistance, most recently with the 
interpretation of messages from GPS receivers.
     Special thanks to Ken Ernandes who wrote his fine program VEC2TLE at 
my urging; VEC2TLE converts state vectors to the standard 2-line elements 
format and has been essential in our support of space shuttle missions. Ken 
also assisted with both code and validation in testing the accuracy of 
STSPLUS in general and its state vectors in particular. Ken, along with 
David Cottle and Dave Simonson, is a member of our team that generates and 
distributes TLEs and state vectors during space shuttle missions.
     In keeping with my desire to interest young people in math and science 
through STSPLUS, I approached NASA Spacelink -- a NASA Teacher Resource 
Center -- and asked if they would post STSPLUS on their system. They have 
done so and have thereby given hundreds of teachers and their students a 
glimpse of satellites and our space program coupled with the opportunity to 
actually see spacecraft pass over in the morning and evening skies. I, in 
turn, have helped NASA Spacelink as a volunteer "expert" from time to time. 
The responses from teachers and students has been most gratifying. My 
thanks to the entire staff at NASA Spacelink!
     Thanks to Rob Matson for offering comments and code to help me 
implement several of STSPLUS's more exotic features; Rob coined the phrase 
"isocontours" to describe the circle of equal satellite altitude around a 
location and his fine SKYMAP program generates high accuracy printed star 
maps with or without satellite tracks.
     And my thanks also to my late friend Joel Runes who passed away in 
January of 1996. Joel was a regular contributor to my RPV Astronomy BBS and 
he also offered many suggestions for STSPLUS. He was tireless in his 
testing and validation to help find and track down many an obscure bug. 
Joel was instrumental in keeping me up to date with current information for 
space shuttle missions and other space and satellite projects. Our frequent 
calls, covering a wide range of mutually interesting subjects, are sorely 
missed. My world is a poorer place for his passing.
     Finally, my thanks to all those individuals who have taken the time to 
write or send e-mail with comments and suggestions. While I haven't 
implemented every suggestion, many are now included and the feedback is 
most welcome.

     For individuals interested in our space program and who have access 
to the Internet, I recommend NASA Spacelink, located at the NASA Marshall 
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, at "http://spacelink.nasa.gov". 
NASA Spacelink provides a wealth of information on NASA and its projects. 
2-line orbital elements for a Space Shuttle mission are usually available 
while the mission is in progress. Also available are educational materials 
and software (including my programs STSORBIT PLUS, STSORBIT, JPLCLOCK, and 
ASTROCLK), general information on NASA programs and plans, news releases, 
and images from NASA space missions.
     For current Space Shuttle orbital information (if a mission is in 
progress), 2-line elements for more than 1,500 satellites, and the most

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------

     A 386DX-class computer running at 20MHz and equipped with a 387 math 
coprocessor chip is the minimum system used for program testing and 
development. While other systems may give acceptable performance, this 
minimum configuration assures that most features will execute as described 
and in real time. Performance with 486DX or higher systems is far superior 
to 386DX systems. Note that NO TESTING is performed on systems not equipped 
with a math coprocessor chip. The following minimum hardware is 
recommended:

          386DX IBM-compatible computer, 486DX or higher recommended
          387/487 math coprocessor chip (if not included in main processor)
          VGA color display
          Hard disk with up to 3MB available
          500KB free RAM

          DeLorme/Garmin GPS Receiver (optional)

     The GPS receiver is required only if it is desired to synchronize the 
computer clock against GPS time (to an accuracy of approximately one 
second) and/or determine and set the current position (latitude, longitude, 
and elevation). My companion program GPSSYNC is required to use the GPS 
receiver with STSPLUS. The current release of GPSSYNC supports GPS 
receivers from DeLorme and Garmin; other brands of GPS receivers may or may 
not operate correctly with GPSSYNC.
     The math coprocessor chip is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED and is REQUIRED for 
acceptable performance. The calculations relating to orbital mechanics are 
very complex and STSPLUS will use the coprocessor if one is equipped; 
performance is improved by about an order of magnitude. Other "fast" 
processor and coprocessor combinations may yield acceptable performance. 
Math coprocessor chips are now reasonably inexpensive and the performance 
improvement is impressive and well worth the modest cost. For example, an 8 
MHz 286 computer without a math coprocessor does NOT provide reasonable 
performance; map drawing times are painfully slow.
     STSPLUS is intended to be used with an EGA or VGA video adapter and a 
color monitor; with these systems, the display is in color. Because of its 
improved vertical resolution, the VGA is recommended over the EGA. A 
monochrome display with shades of gray may also be used with the program 
(with the "/M" command line option). Because of hardware limitations, CGA 
and HGC systems can only present graphics in monochrome; although those 
display adapters are supported to some degree in current versions of 
STSPLUS, that support may NOT continue in future versions. The original 
STSORBIT will continue to support CGA and HGC monitors.
     A hard disk is required for performance reasons and for storage of the 
program, map databases and orbital elements files. A RAM disk or disk cache 
(such as SMARTDRV) with sufficient space to hold the various data files may 
also be used for improved performance and to reduce wear and tear on the 
hard disk during periods of extended use.
     Processor speed is not the only factor determining overall program 
performance. Data buss speed, video adapters and hard disk drives have not Šquite kept up with the improvements in the processor and can be a limiting 
factor. As measured in early 1998, for example, typical P166 and P333 
Pentium systems exhibit almost identical minimum map drawing times (when 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 8


used in an optimized configuration) of approximately 0.5 seconds. In this 
example, it is likely data transfer speed and the video adapter which are 
limiting performance. (Both systems had 66MHz data buss speed.)
     STSPLUS is a large program and requires significant memory. As of 
Version 9726, the program requires approximately 500KB of RAM. Systems 
which have less RAM available may fail to execute the program with a 
"Not enough memory" error.
     Although the program may execute properly on other software operating 
systems, STSPLUS has been designed and tested using standard configurations 
of Microsoft DOS 3.3, 5.0, and 6.x, Windows 95, and Windows NT. No optional 
Terminate and Stay Resident programs (TSR's) or "shell" programs have been 
tested except for standard DOS programs supplied by Microsoft (like MOUSE 
and DOSKEY). Third party memory management programs and other operating 
systems may experience problems; I am unable to test other operating 
system configurations.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
-------------------

     A typical Space Shuttle orbit is nearly, but almost never exactly, 
circular with an altitude of approximately 160 nautical miles to a maximum 
of approximately 300 nautical miles and an inclination of about 28 degrees 
through about 61 degrees. Occasional missions, especially military 
missions, fly at higher altitudes and/or inclinations and often use more 
elliptical orbits. Prior to 1990, little of this information was known to 
very good accuracy by the casual listener. At that time, therefore, the 
interested would-be mission observer had only the time and date of launch 
and intended orbital altitude and inclination to initialize a tracking 
program. Given the geographical coordinates of the Kennedy Space Center and 
assuming a circular orbit, the data was sufficient to calculate at least a 
rough idea of the Shuttle's position for the first several orbits. After 
that, additional information was required if the position was going to be 
very close. This was the method used in my original STSORBIT program prior 
to the time that 2-line orbital elements were available.
     Estimated 2-line elements are usually available prior to a space 
shuttle launch and I usually post 2-line elements based upon actual state 
vector data within two hours of a launch. 2-line elements from NASA or US 
Space Command are usually available 8 to 12 hours after launch. Using 2-
line elements for any satellite is quite simple; no adjustment of orbital 
parameters is necessary. A copy of the 2-line element file available at the 
time of this release of STSPLUS is included in the distribution files and 
includes approximately 800 satellites. The data for each satellite is 
referenced to a specific date and time, the "Epoch" of the data. As a 
general rule, orbital calculations will be relatively accurate for 10 to 20 
days after the Epoch date, absent maneuvers; the lower the orbit, the 
greater the effect of factors such as atmospheric drag and the less 
accurate the calculations will be as time passes.
     STSPLUS displays a portion of the Earth using either an orthographic 
projection (the Earth seen as a globe) or cylindrical projection (similar 
to the Mercator projection commonly used). The maps show most of the 
Earth's land boundaries and continental areas. Major oceans, seas, and 
rivers are easily recognizable. Considerable detail is shown at higher zoom 
factors. Automatic map generation ensures that the satellite is always 
displayed. The display shows the selected satellite as a small symbol or 
icon, the projected orbital ground track for the next three hours and the 
past one and a half hours, and many other features including circles of 
visibility, TDRS coverage, and the solar terminator.
     Data are displayed which give the current ground track position of the 
satellite, known as the "sub-satellite point", antenna or viewing angles, 
spacecraft lighting, TDRS communications coverage (when applicable), and a 
variety of other information. A selection of map modes and display features 
allow users to configure the program to meet their requirements.
     STSPLUS has been validated by the USAF and is approved for use on the 
Eastern and Western Ranges. It is sufficiently accurate (given current and 
accurate 2-line orbital elements, of course!) that the program is being 
used operationally by NASA, USAF, ESA, RSA, and Intelsat. Among the current 
users are:
Š          NASA/Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, CA
          NASA/Lewis Telescience Support Center, Cleveland, OH
          NASA TDRS Control Centers, White Sands, NM

          RSA Control Center, Korolev (formerly Kaliningrad), Russia
          ESA Astronaut Training Centre, Cologne, Germany

To the best of my knowledge, STSPLUS is the only satellite tracking program 
which has actually flown in space -- on the Mir Space Station! In addition 
to these official or semi-official users, thousands of amateur radio 
operators and "just plain folks" all over the world use STSPLUS to track 
the space shuttle and other satellites.


STSORBIT PLUS FILES

     STSORBIT PLUS is normally distributed via the Internet or bulletin 
board systems in archived form using the ZIP format by PKWare. Note that 
all files (except map databases) for STSORBIT PLUS are called "STSPLUS" in 
order to conform to DOS filename requirements and to avoid confusion with 
the similarly named files for the original STSORBIT. The following files

     *    The EARTH3 files are available separately for download from my 
          WWW Home Page and are also included with registration. The EARTH2 
          and EARTH1 are available by mail only to registered users of 
          STSORBIT PLUS for an additional donation.

     **   Available by mail only and included with with registration of

     ***  The GPSSYNC program files are available separately for download 
          from my WWW Home Page. GPSSYNC is only required for use with a 
          GPS receiver to determine time and position.

Files noted as "(required)" must be in the current default directory (or in 
a specified directory in some cases) for program operation. Files noted as 
"(optional)" are not required when STSPLUS is operated but provide 
additional features or information if present. In order to minimize the 
disk space required, all .EXE files have been compressed with PKWare's 
PKLITE Professional; these files require a small amount of additional time 
to begin execution since they are decompressed "on the fly" at load time.

                          ***  IMPORTANT NOTE ***

     File STSPLUS.INI contains initialization data from previous runs 
     of the program. If file STSPLUS.INI is not present it will be Š     created. Note that if STSPLUS.INI was written by a version prior 
     to 9405, all data will be ignored and the program must be 
     initialized as if being run for the first time.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 12




     STSPLUS can use map databases with different degrees of map detail. 
Level 4, required for operation, contains the minimum detail and Level 1 
contains the maximum detail. As noted in the list above, three files are 
used for each level of map detail: MCX files contain an index of the map 
data; MCP files contain map coordinates for rectangular projection; and 
XYZ files contain map coordinates for orthographic projection. STSPLUS 
checks for the levels that are present and uses the level appropriate for 
the zoom factor in effect or, if that level is not present, the maximum 
level that is present. Level 1 is checked first, then Level 2, etc. Level 4 
files MUST be present or an error message is displayed and the program 
aborts.

                          ***  IMPORTANT NOTE ***

     STSPLUS assumes that if a particular level of map database is 
     found, ALL lower levels of map database are present. Missing 
     levels of map database will cause a program error.


     File STSPLUS.FRQ contains a list of preset frequencies for amateur 
radio satellites and is not required except when STSPLUS is operated in the 
Doppler Shift Mode. See the section "Satellite Communications and Amateur 
Radio" for additional information.
     File STSPLUS.KEY is a quick reference list of the keys that are 
active while the map is displayed and includes a brief description of the 
function of each key. It has been extracted from this documentation.
     File STSPLUS.LTD contains the launch date and time for selected 
satellites. The file may be updated when new satellite launch date and 
time data are entered via the program.
     Files with filetype .TRK are tracking station locations or other 
locations of interest which may be plotted on the map. These files may be 
created or edited with a standard ASCII editor. If you wish to use a 
different TRK file, use Function Key F7 from the Main Menu to select 
the desired file.
     File STSPLUS.SAA contains data characterizing the South Atlantic 
Anomaly zone (SAA). Display of the SAA is controlled by F10+F7 from the 
Main Menu. If the file is not present or is corrupt, the South Atlantic 
Anomaly will be disabled; users are cautioned NOT to alter the contents of 
file STSPLUS.SAA or the results may be unpredictable.
     File STSPLUS.SCF is a sample multiple satellite configuration file 
which may be used to display multiple TDRS and real time satellites. Up to 
48 additional satellites may be tracked using this feature. Use F6 from the 
Main Menu to create or modify SCF files.
     File STSPLUS.XRF is a satellite name cross-reference file (NORAD 
Number to Satellite Name) which may be used to substitute a preferred name 
for that found in a TLE file. STSPLUS.XRF must be in the same directory as 
the main program. See the section Satellite Cross-Reference for additional 
information.
     File TLEnnn.TXT (where "nnn" will be a number such as "153") is a set 
of USSPACECOM 2-line elements as of the date of the file. Note that the 2-Šline elements should only be used for ten to twenty days after the epoch 
date for each satellite if reasonable accuracy is to be maintained. Current 
orbital elements are regularly posted on my WWW home page or bulletin board 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 13


system and elsewhere. Other files with 2-line elements are also available; 
they typically have names like GSFCnnn.TXT or N2L-nnn.TXT for general 
satellites, and STSmmRnn.TXT for Space Shuttle missions. Space Shuttle 
orbital elements are usually posted at least daily during missions and are 
available via our STSTLE distribution list via e-mail; because of frequent 
orbital maneuvers, Space Shuttle elements more than 24 hours old may yield 
inaccurate positions.
     File STSPLUS.LOC contains geographic coordinates and labels for 
selected locations and major oceans and seas. These labels may optionally 
be displayed on the maps. The file may be edited with a standard ASCII 
editor to add or delete locations and features. See the section "Location 
and Features Labels" for additional information.
     Other files, such as 2-line elements for an upcoming Space Shuttle 
mission or a mission in progress, may be included from time to time. Files 
with 2-line orbital elements normally have filetype ".TXT" or ".TLE". Some 
common satellite name abbreviations are:

          STS       Space Shuttle missions
          HST       Hubble Space Telescope
          GRO       Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
          UARS      Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite
          TOPEX     Topex/Poseidon Earth Resources Satellite
          ROSAT     Roentgen Satellite Observatory
          MIR       Russian Space Station

There are many other satellites for which data is available. US Space 
Command (formerly NORAD) currently tracks some 7000+ objects, of which data 
for more than 1600 is usually included in the full TLyymmdd.TXT files 
posted on my RPV bulletin board system.


INITIAL STSPLUS SETUP
---------------------

     This section gives quick instructions for setting up STSORBIT PLUS in 
a standard configuration. Other methods are possible but this is 
recommended for the first time or novice user.


Copying Files for STSORBIT PLUS
-------------------------------

     STSPLUS is intended to be used on systems with a hard disk. If all 
files are present, up to 3MB may be required. While it is possible to 
operate the program from a high density floppy disk (with some files 
omitted), map drawing times are painfully and unacceptably slow.
     I recommend that a separate directory called STSPLUS be created for 
all of the required and optional files. If you do not have such a 
directory, you may create one with the following DOS commands:

          C:
          CD \Š          MD STSPLUS

where the hard disk is assumed to be Drive C:. Change the hard disk letter 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 14


as appropriate for your configuration.
     If you received the program in compressed, self-extracting .EXE format 
(with a filename like SOP0123.EXE), create the STSPLUS directory as above 
then log into the STSPLUS directory and unpack the files with the following 
DOS commands:

          C:
          CD \STSPLUS
          A:SOP0123

where the floppy drive is assumed to be A:, the hard disk is assumed to be 
C:, and the subdirectory STSPLUS must already exist. Make any changes 
appropriate for your configuration, then repeat the last command for each 
file with filetype .EXE received, changing the command as necessary to 
reflect the correct filename. 
     If you received the program in compressed format (.ZIP), copy the .ZIP 
file(s) to the STSPLUS directory and then enter the DOS command:

          PKUNZIP <filename>

where <filename> is the name of the .ZIP file to unpack. After all files 
have been unpacked, you may delete the .ZIP files (but keep a backup copy 
just in case!). You MUST use PKUNZIP Version 2.04G or later to successfully 
unpack .ZIP files received from my WWW home page!

                           ********************
                           *  IMPORTANT NOTE  *
                           ********************

     If you are upgrading from a prior version of STSPLUS and 
     experience problems, delete the file STSPLUS.INI to force the 
     program to recreate its initialization parameters! This will 
     resolve most path and filename problems. Use the "/NEW" command 
     line option or press Function Keys F7 and F10+F3 from the Main 
     Menu to set all program paths, filenames, options, and display 
     features.

File WIN95.TXT gives a complete setup procedure for running STSPLUS under 
Windows 95/98.

Executing Program STSORBIT PLUS
-------------------------------

     STSPLUS is normally distributed on disk, via my WWW home page, and via 
several Internet sites with a special version of file STSPLUS.INI, the 
initialization file, which forces certain setup features to be selected. 
The setup feature may also be enabled by including the "/NEW" command line 
option when the program is executed from the DOS prompt:

     STSPLUS /NEW

STSPLUS will display its title screen for a few seconds and then notify the Šuser that the new setup features are being processed:

     Program STSPLUS, Version 0123
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 15



     STSPLUS has determined that this is a new setup. You will be asked to
     select your location, enter your UTC Offset and other time information,
     and to check the files and paths for program operation.

     Press any key to continue ...

Press ENTER (or any key except non-typing keys like SHIFT and CTRL) to 
continue the setup process.
     Because many calculations require the user's location, STSPLUS next 
requests the user to verify and change, if necessary, the current location. 
The default location is Sedona, Arizona (near Flagstaff):

     Current PRIMARY Location:      Sedona, AZ
                                    Latitude:     34.9153 degrees
                                    Longitude:  -111.7885 degrees
                                    Elevation:  1311      meters
     Current active CITYFILE:       STSPLUS.CTY

        F1  Search CITYFILE for PRIMARY location
        F2  Search CITYFILE for SECONDARY location
        F3  Enter coordinates for PRIMARY location
        F4  Enter coordinates for SECONDARY location

        F6  Select TRACKING STN for PRIMARY location

     ENTER  Continue Setup

     Enter desired selection:

     If this is a new setup, press F1 and enter the name of a city
     close to your location. If the city is not found, try another
     or press F3 and enter the city name and coordinates. When the
     information is correct, press ENTER to continue.

If the "/NEW" command line option has been entered and this is a 
reconfiguration of an existing setup, the primary location which was 
previously entered will be displayed. Press F1 to search the CITYFILE (a 
file of some 2000+ cities worldwide) to locate your city or one near you. 
If your city is not found, try another. If no nearby city can be found, 
press F3 and enter the city name, latitude (positive is North, negative is 
South), longitude (positive is East [Europe, Africa, Australia, etc.], 
negative is West [North and South America, etc.]), and elevation (in 
meters, or add "F" for feet). Enter "0" for your elevation if it is not 
known. When the information is correct, press ENTER to continue the setup 
process.
     STSPLUS next requests time zone information. STSPLUS must know your 
"UTC Offset", the difference in hours between your local time zone and UTC 
or Coordinated Universal Time (formerly known as GMT or Greenwich Mean 
Time and still referred to as such by NASA). Using the primary location 
entered above, STSPLUS will calculate an estimated UTC Offset based upon 
your longitude; each 15 degrees of longitude represents one hour offset Šfrom UTC. Do NOT include the hour for Daylight or Summer time! However, 
political "adjustments" have caused the time zones to not coincide exactly 
with the 15 degree model, so the estimate could be off by one hour in 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 16


either direction in some cases. For most users the estimate should be 
correct. Users whose UTC Offset is not an exact hour difference from UTC 
must always enter the UTC Offset manually. STSPLUS next requests whether 
you are on Daylight or Summer time; enter "0" if you are on Standard Time 
and "1" if you are on Daylight or Summer Time. Finally, STSPLUS allows you 
to select either local time or UTC as the time to which your computer's 
clock is set; enter "0" for local time and "1" for UTC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set UTC TIME ZONE OFFSET and DAYLIGHT FLAG

STSPLUS must know the difference between your local time zone and Universal
Coordinated Time (UTC), also sometimes known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
With this information, STSPLUS can automatically adjust launch times and
dates for your local time zone. In addition, STSORBIT must know if you are
now on STANDARD or DAYLIGHT (SUMMER) time and if the DOS clock is set to 
UTC or Local Time.

First, enter the difference between your STANDARD time zone and UTC in hours.
Do NOT include the hour for DAYLIGHT time; it will be entered separately.
STSPLUS will estimate your time zone based upon your local longitude.
For the United States and Canada, use the following:

  Eastern Standard Time     EST    -5.00
  Central Standard Time     CST    -6.00
  Mountain Standard Time    MST    -7.00
  Pacific Standard Time     PST    -8.00

Enter UTC Offset (hours) [ -7.00]:
Enter Daylight Flag (0=OFF, 1=ON)  [0]:
Enter DOS time zone (0=LOCAL, 1=UTC)  [0]:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The prompts and responses shown above are for Arizona which always remains 
on Mountain Standard Time (UTC-7 hours). Most users will have to take 
Daylight Savings Time into account from April through October.

                           ********************
                           *  IMPORTANT NOTE  *
                           ********************

     The single most common cause of problems with STSPLUS is 
     that the UTC Offset or Daylight Flag is incorrectly set. Not 
     surprisingly, this will cause a gross error in the 
     calculated position of any satellite. Verify that both the 
     UTC time/date and local time/date and abbreviation are correct!

     Because installations can vary considerably as to the names and 
locations of various required files, STSPLUS next displays the current 
filename and path settings. For a fresh installation from the standard 
distribution files, these should be correct; if this is a reconfiguration 
of a previously configured setup using the "/NEW" command line option, the Šcurrent information should be correct.

     Select path or filename to set, press ENTER when done:
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 17



       F1  Set 2-LINE ELEMENTS path:      [D:\STSPLUS\]
       F2  Set TRACKING STATION filename: [STSPLUS.TRK]
       F3  Set MAP DATABASE FILES path:   [D:\STSPLUS\]
       F4  Set FEATURES LABEL filename:   [STSPLUS.LOC]
       F5  Set TRAKSTAR path:             [D:\STSPLUS\]
       F6  Set CITYFILE filename:         [STSPLUS.CTY]

     Enter selection or ENTER:

The sample above shows STSPLUS installed in a directory STSPLUS on Drive 
D:. Verify each of the items in the list and press the indicated Function 
Key to make changes. When all information is correct, press ENTER to 
complete the setup process and go to the STSPLUS Main Menu.

     The following sequence of operations is recommended when STSPLUS is 
run for the first time:

1.   Make sure all required STSPLUS files are in subdirectory \STSPLUS (or 
     whatever you named it). In addition to the program files, check that 
     2-line elements are also available; the file TLEnnn.TXT (where "nnn" 
     is a number like "679" is usually supplied with STSPLUS) and similar 
     files are available via the Internet.

2.   Start STSPLUS with the following command to force configuration:

          STSPLUS /NEW

     STSPLUS will request that the user set the primary location, UTC 
     Offset, Daylight Flag, and check all filenames and paths. Enter the 
     appropriate responses. Examples are shown on the screen and are 
     described above.

3.   Once the Main Menu is displayed, press Function Key F2 to select the 
     primary satellite you wish to track with STSPLUS. You will be asked to 
     select a filename (the available files whose filetype is ".TXT" or 
     ".TLE" are displayed and may be selected using the arrow keys). Type 
     the filename or press ENTER after selecting a filename using the arrow 
     keys. You will then be asked to select a satellite by name or NORAD 
     number. If you do not know a specific satellite name, enter "HST" for 
     the Hubble Space Telescope. (Caution: some TLE files also include "HST 
     Array"; press the SPACE BAR to continue searching for HST.) The data 
     for the satellite is displayed; press ENTER to accept the data. 
     STSPLUS will immediately begin drawing the map.

4.   While the map is displayed you may press ENTER to return to the Main 
     Menu. Press ESC at the Main Menu to return to the DOS prompt.

5.   STSPLUS is a complex program. Only the most basic and essential 
     features have been covered in this brief startup list. Please take 
     time to read the manual with your favorite editor or print the text as 
     reference material. CAUTION: This is a long document, over 200 pages!Š

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 18


Using Mission Elapsed Time (MET)
---------------------------------

     Mission Elapsed Time (MET) is the time since launch of a specific 
satellite or mission. The standard NASA/NORAD 2-line orbital element format 
does NOT include either launch time or launch date. However, this 
information is obviously required if MET is to be displayed. That 
information must therefore be obtained independently and manually entered 
into STSPLUS. The following steps are required:

1.   Start program STSPLUS (see above).

2.   Load the 2-line elements for the desired satellite using Function Key 
     F2 on the Main Menu. Press ENTER to return from the ground track 
     display to the Main Menu.

3.   Press Function Key F5 to enter Launch Time and Launch Date. Enter the 
     appropriate information. Note that if you enter UTC or GMT Launch Time 
     (by adding the letter "U" or "G" at the end of the time, upper or 
     lower case), STSPLUS assumes that the date you enter will also be the 
     UTC/GMT Launch Date.

4.   The information will be displayed for approval. Press ENTER to accept 
     the data, or press SPACE BAR to repeat the process.

5.   Once the data have been accepted, press Function Key F5 while the map 
     is on screen to display Mission Elapsed Time. Press F5 again to return 
     to Time Since Epoch ("T+E" or "T+Epoch"). The Epoch is the time at 
     which the orbital data in the TLEs was calculated. (Press Function Key 
     F1 for help when the map is displayed.) If a launch time and date have 
     not been entered, the F5 command will have no effect and Time Since 
     Epoch will always be displayed. The launch time and date may be saved 
     in file STSPLUS.LTD and MET will automatically be displayed if the 
     satellite's data is found in that file.

6.   The launch time and launch date will be saved in file STSPLUS.LTD and 
     need only be entered once unless it must be changed for some reason.

     NOTE: Estimated Pre-Launch 2-Line Elements for the Space Shuttle 
     always use a "dummy" NORAD Number (such as "99984" for STS-84). Once 
     US Space Command has assigned the actual NORAD Number, the launch time 
     and date must be re-entered using the correct NORAD number.

PROGRAM USAGE NOTES
-------------------

     The following notes may prove helpful in setting up STSPLUS to operate 
most efficiently on your system or to provide hints in ways that some of 
the system and program features may be used to advantage.

Using STSPLUS with Windows 95/98 and Windows NT
-----------------------------------------------

     Using STSPLUS with Windows 95/98
     --------------------------------

     STSPLUS is a DOS-based program and must be executed from the DOS 
feature of Windows 95/98 since STSPLUS is a 16-bit program. Comments for 
Windows 95 also apply to Windows 98. While there are several methods for 
obtaining a DOS prompt ("C:>") with Windows 95, limited testing has shown 
that the following method offers the most reliable operation:

1.   Start Windows 95 in the normal manner.

2.   OLDER WIN95 SYSTEMS: Click on "Start", then select "Shut Down" 
     followed by "Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode".

     NEWER WIN95 SYSTEMS: Click on "Start", then "Programs", then "MS-DOS 
     Prompt". This method uses a "DOS Window" and may yield better 
     performance than restarting in MS-DOS Mode, especially recent systems 
     using Win95 Service Release #2.

3.   You should receive a typical DOS prompt (such as "C:\WINDOWS>").

4.   Using standard DOS commands, create the subdirectory STSPLUS from the 
     root directory and then log into that new subdirectory:

          C:
          CD \
          MD STSPLUS
          CD STSPLUS

5.   The standard Windows 95 MS-DOS setup does NOT include SMARTDRV, the 
     Microsoft disk caching software. Map drawing times and disk accesses 
     can be substantially reduced by enabling SMARTDRV. (SMARTDRV may not 
     be permitted in a DOS window.) To do so, enter the following command 
     at the DOS prompt:

          SMARTDRV /X

     The "/X" command line parameter disables write-behind caching, which I 
     recommend as the safest mode of operating SMARTDRV. Using SMARTDRV, 
     the map drawing time for STSPLUS on a Pentium 166 drops from just over 
     1 second to just over half a second! You may also include the SMARTDRV 
     command above in AUTOEXEC.BAT so that it is executed automatically.Š
6.   EXECUTION METHOD #1: Install STSPLUS on your Windows 95/98 desktop by 
     following the detailed procedure in file WIN95.TXT. This procedure is 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 20


     RECOMMENDED for all Windows users! This method sets various system 
     parameters to insure proper operation. To execute STSPLUS, simply 
     double click on the STSPLUS icon on your desktop. To exit STSPLUS and 
     return to your desktop, press ESC from the STSPLUS Main Menu.

7.   EXECUTION METHOD #2: Load and execute STSPLUS in accordance with the 
     standard instructions contained in this documentation and/or the 
     documentation accompanying the STSPLUS files or disks. When STSPLUS 
     operations have been completed, exit STSPLUS (ESC from the Main Menu), 
     then type "EXIT" at the DOS prompt to return to Windows 95. Resume 
     normal Windows 95 operations.

     STSPLUS is a DOS-based program and should be run from the MS-DOS 
prompt or in accordance with the procedure given in file WIN95.TXT. 
Executing STSPLUS from an icon in the programs menu does not always operate 
correctly, apparently because Win95 does not emulate DOS graphics correctly 
in some respects (such as clipping) in the original release. Using a DOS 
window enables multitasking and STSPLUS has been known to freeze the 
computer when other tasks are executed in either foreground or background.


     Using STSPLUS with Windows NT
     -----------------------------

     Releases of STSPLUS prior to Version 9643 had a problem when executed 
on Windows NT (only!) which prevented the clocks in STSPLUS from reading 
the correct system time. The local clock always started at 00:00:00. The 
code which detected the processor and coprocessor in those versions has 
been replaced by a simple INT 11H call to verify the presence of the math 
coprocessor in the "BIOS equipment list" -- a call which does NOT always 
perform correctly in older computers. However, this call is accepted by 
Windows NT. I normally execute STSPLUS from the WinNT MS-DOS Prompt.


Using STSPLUS with program STSUPDAT by Greg Swift              (03/27/2000)
-------------------------------------------------

     STSPLUS requires current orbital data ("TLEs" or "2-Line Elements") 
for accurate satellite tracking. For satellites in low Earth orbit, such as 
the Space Shuttle or International Space Station, these TLEs should be 
updated no less frequently than weekly, more often if the satellite may be 
maneuvering or adjusting its orbit; for satellites in higher orbits, these 
TLEs should be updated no less frequently than monthly. Displaying the 
secondary satellites with F6+F1 from the STSPLUS Main Menu will mark 
outdated TLEs with "**" to remind users that these data should be updated.
     Greg Swift has written an add-on program for STSPLUS called STSUPDAT 
to automate the TLE update process for STSPLUS via the Internet. Users not 
familiar with file downloads and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) via the 
Internet will find STSUPDAT helpful since it makes that process completely 
transparent to the user. Experienced users will appreciate the convenience 
of STSUPDAT. STSPLUS and STSUPDAT have been closely coordinated to assure 
trouble-free and robust operation. Unfortunately for 16-bit users of DOS or ŠWindows 3.11, STSUPDAT requires the 32-bit environment of Windows 
95/98/NT4/2000 for proper operation. The following are the requirements for 
operation of STSUPDAT:
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 21



     - Windows 95/98/NT4/2000 (see usage note on WinNT4 below)
     - WinSock 2 features installed (Windows 95 only)
     - STSPLUS Version 0016 or later
     - PKUNZIP Version 2.04G or PKZIP25 Version 2.50
     - Internet service capable of FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

     As a public service for STSPLUS users and other satellite tracking 
enthusiasts, I process and post updated TLEs on my websites several times 
weekly. One file, TLyymmdd.ZIP (where "yymmdd" is the date code for the 
file such as TL000211.ZIP for 11 February 2000) is a composite file of all 
publicly available TLEs from US Space Command. The three most recent 
TLyymmdd.ZIP files are always posted. These TLE files are available at:

     ftp://ftp.dransom.com/current.data

     STSUPDAT is distributed as a self-extracting archive file with a 
filename of the form SUnnnn.EXE, where "nnnn" is the current version number 
(as in SU0014.EXE). To install STSUPDAT, simply copy the EXE file to your 
STSPLUS directory and execute the file to extract the actual program files. 
For example, from the DOS prompt in your STSPLUS directory, type the 
following command:

     SU0014

Substitute the actual filename in the example shown above. All required 
STSUPDAT files will then be placed in your STSPLUS directory, ready for 
use. STSUPDAT may not execute using Function Key F11 (see below) if it is 
located a different directory. Users are encouraged to read the STSUPDAT 
documentation for a complete description of the program features and 
options.
     STSUPDAT takes advantage of the availability of these TLE files and 
will automatically retrieve the latest TLyymmdd.ZIP file and update the 
TLEs currently in use by STSPLUS with a single keystroke. The entire 
process is almost completely transparent to the STSPLUS user and typically 
requires from one to three minutes (depending upon the speed of the user's 
Internet connection and current Internet traffic) to execute -- while 
STSPLUS continues normal operation. When the updated TLEs are in place, 
STSPLUS redraws the map using the new TLEs and the update sequence is 
complete.
     For those interested in the details and options available with 
STSUPDAT, please see the STSUPDAT documentation included in the STSUPDAT 
distribution package. For those only interested in a quick summary of 
operation, the following procedures describe operation in STSUPDAT's 
default mode (as normally triggered from STSPLUS).

RECOMMENDED METHOD OF OPERATION FOR WINDOWS 95/98:

     This method of operation is recommended for novice users and requires 
only a single keypress (F11) to initiate the entire process. Advanced users 
may also find this method the most convenient.
Š     1.   An active Internet connection is REQUIRED prior to the execution 
          of STSUPDAT with STSPLUS. Connect to your Internet service BEFORE 
          executing STSPLUS.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 22



     2.   Execute STSPLUS in the normal manner, making sure that STSPLUS 
          LAN operations are ENABLED with F10+F1 from the STSPLUS Main 
          Menu. Once enabled, LAN operations will remain enabled until 
          manually disabled with F10+F1.

     3.   When TLE updates are desired, press F11 while the satellite 
          tracking map is displayed. STSPLUS will display "WAIT" in YELLOW 
          at the upper right of the screen. STSUPDAT will be loaded and 
          requested to download the current TLEs from my website (the 
          primary site will be used if available, otherwise the mirror site 
          will be used). Users with an external modem may observe the 
          Internet traffic on their modem.

          NOTE: If STSUPDAT cannot be found or fails to execute, "WAIT" 
          will continue to be displayed until the map is redrawn.

     4.   STSUPDAT will request the TLyymmdd.ZIP file for the current date. 
          If that file is not available, STSUPDAT will work backwards until 
          the most recent posted file is found and downloaded. The received 
          TLyymmdd.ZIP file will be unZIPped (using PKZIP25.EXE Version 
          2.50 by PKWare, the shareware version of which is included in the 
          STSUPDAT distribution package) and renamed to STSPLUS.TLE. If a 
          shuttle mission is in progress, file STSNEW.TXT will also be 
          downloaded. The new file(s) will replace any older file(s) of the 
          same name and will be placed in the TLE directory specified by 
          STSPLUS. Use F7+F1 from the STSPLUS Main Menu to specify the 
          desired drive and path for the TLE directory; the default 
          directory is the STSPLUS directory.

          NOTE: If STSUPDAT detects an error, "ERR!" will be displayed in 
          RED at the upper right of the screen. Examine file STSUPDAT.LOG 
          for details as to the error detected.

          CAUTION: When executed from STSPLUS, STSUPDAT allows 120 seconds 
          for each download. If you receive repeated errors after pressing 
          F11/CTRL-F2, examine file STSUPDAT.LOG for the cause and run 
          STSUPDAT in the standalone mode if necessary. See the STSUPDAT 
          documentation for additional information regarding the usage of 
          the MAXWAIT parameter to increase the default timeout value from 
          120 seconds to a higher value.

     5.   Once the new TLEs have been received, STSUPDAT will examine the 
          TLEs currently in use by STSPLUS and update any for which more 
          recent TLEs have been received. If the TLEs for the primary 
          satellite have been updated, the displayed filename (orthographic 
          projection only) will be updated to reflect the file used.

     6.   When all TLE updates are complete, STSUPDAT signals STSPLUS to 
          re-read the TLEs and redraw the satellite tracking map. When 
          STSPLUS has completed that process it signals that fact to 
          STSUPDAT, which then sleeps until either another TLE update Š          sequence is initiated with F11/CTRL-F2 or STSPLUS terminates. 
          When STSPLUS terminates, it also signals STSUPDAT to terminate. 
          When STSPLUS terminates, it also signals STSUPDAT to terminate. 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 23


          Examine file STSUPDAT.LOG for details after both programs have 
          terminated.

RECOMMENDED METHOD OF OPERATION FOR WINDOWS NT/2000:

     This method of operation is recommended for Windows NT/2000 and is 
suggested when STSUPDAT must be executed with other than the default 
parameters or if the F11 method (above) fails to execute properly. See the 
STSUPDAT documentation for additional information.

     1.   An active Internet connection is REQUIRED prior to the execution 
          of STSUPDAT. Connect to your Internet service BEFORE executing 
          STSUPDAT.

     2.   From a DOS prompt in the STSPLUS directory (the recommended 
          location for the STSUPDAT files), type "STSUPDAT" (without the 
          quotes). STSUPDAT will identify itself and thereafter run in 
          background. The user is returned to the DOS prompt.

     3.   Now execute STSPLUS in the normal manner, making sure that 
          STSPLUS LAN operations are ENABLED with F10+F1 from the STSPLUS 
          Main Menu. Once enabled, LAN operations will remain enabled until 
          manually disabled with F10+F1.

     4.   Proceed with normal STSPLUS operations and press ENTER from the 
          STSPLUS Main Menu to display the satellite tracking map.

     5.   When TLE updates are desired, press CTRL-F2 while the STSPLUS 
          satellite tracking map is displayed. STSPLUS will display "WAIT" 
          in YELLOW at the upper right of the screen. STSUPDAT will have 
          been requested to download the current TLEs from my website (the 
          primary site will be used if available, otherwise the mirror site 
          will be used). Users with an external modem may observe the 
          Internet traffic on their modem.

          NOTE: If STSUPDAT cannot be found or fails to execute, "WAIT" 
          will continue to be displayed until the map is redrawn.

     6.   Operations will continue beginning with Step 4 in the RECOMMENDED 
          METHOD OF OPERATION FOR WINDOWS 95/98 above.

STSUPDAT USAGE NOTES
--------------------

1.   WINDOWS 95 USERS ONLY: STSUPDAT requires that the Microsoft WinSock 2 
     features be installed. (These features are included in Windows 98.) If 
     the latest WinSock 2 features are missing, a system error message will 
     appear:

          "A required DLL file, WS2_32.DLL was not found"

     A setup file, W95WS2SETUP.EXE (963KB), is available which will install Š     the latest WinSock 2 features at the following Microsoft address:

          http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/bin/W95ws2setup.exe
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 24



     Download the file and execute it to install the latest WinSock 2.

2.   WINDOWS NT4/2000 USERS ONLY: Only a limited number of Windows NT4/2000 
     sites have been tested with STSPLUS and STSUPDAT. Of those tested, 
     most had problems when STSUPDAT was executed with F11 from STSPLUS. 
     The F11 method caused some disruption to the tracking map display. The 
     CTRL-F2 method above appears to resolve these problems.

3.   The orbital data files on my websites, TLyymmdd.ZIP, have been 
     compressed using a ZIP compression utility. In order to decompress 
     these files, STSUPDAT requires that PKZIP25 Version 2.50 be in the 
     STSPLUS directory or in the system PATH. The shareware version of 
     PKZIP25 is included in the distribution package for STSUPDAT. 

4.   STSUPDAT may be executed independently of STSPLUS, especially when 
     special command line options are desired. See the STSUPDAT 
     documentation for information on this mode of operation.

5.   Firewall users may need to configure their firewall software to allow 
     Internet access to several specific programs, including STSUPDAT.EXE. 
     The standard "system" programs used internally by STSUPDAT which may 
     need authorization are FTP.EXE and PING.EXE. The very first execution 
     of a new version of STSUPDAT which causes Internet access to occur may 
     result in STSPLUS being minimized to the task bar while you grant the 
     appropriate permission to the program(s). If this happens, grant the 
     request and then reactivate the STSPLUS program by clicking its icon 
     on the task bar.

     Using STSUPDAT provides a convenient means to quickly and 
automatically update the current TLEs in use by STSPLUS. My thanks to Greg 
for his program, a substantial enhancement to STSPLUS. Please direct

Using STSPLUS at Night with "Night Vision" Mode
-----------------------------------------------

     With the increased availability -- and lower cost -- of color laptop 
computers, many STSPLUS users are taking their laptops outside at night to 
both watch satellites and continue tracking with STSPLUS. Unfortunately, ŠSTSPLUS' normal bright multi-color screens tend to reduce night vision 
adaptation. Using the "Night Vision" mode changes all screen colors to RED 
or LIGHT RED and substantially reduces the effect on night vision 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 25


adaptation. Good night vision typically takes from five to ten minutes as 
the eye adapts to lower light levels. Even a momentary glimpse of a bright 
white light (or computer screen) can require several minutes before good 
night vision returns. The color red has far less effect on night vision 
than other colors and has been used in astronomical environments for years 
to help astronomers preserve night vision. (My program ASTROCLK has had a 
red night vision mode for many years for that reason.)
     "Night Vision" mode is enabled and disabled using the ALT-R key 
combination (press the "ALT" key and while holding it down press and 
release the "R" key, then release the "ALT" key). When enabled, "Night 
Vision" mode changes all colors except light white to RED and changes light 
white to LIGHT RED. This screen mode may be activated from the Main Menu or 
at any time while the map is displayed; the screen is immediately redrawn 
if ALT-R is pressed while the map is displayed. Press ALT-R again to resume 
normal screen colors. The "Night Vision" mode is NOT saved and must be re-
enabled each time STSPLUS is executed. Night Vision mode has no effect when 
used with monochrome screens ("/M" command line option used). When setting 
user definable colors (F10+F9 from the Main Menu), normal colors are always 
used and the Night Vision mode will be restored if it was in effect.
     Since the "Night Vision" mode is essentially a monochrome screen (in 
red and black rather than white and black), users may find that temporarily 
disabling some screen features, such as rivers, location labels or 
additional grid lines, may make the red screen easier to read. I am always 
surprised at how much additional information may be included on a screen 
when color is used without "cluttering" the screen to the point where it 
may be confusing; the converse is also true.


DOS Memory Managers and Performance Tips
----------------------------------------

     The use of memory managers such as EMM386, QEMM386, and 386MAX (but 
not NETROOM3 by Helix Software, see below) with 386 and higher systems will 
cause the processor to operate in the Virtual 8086 Mode, a "feature" which 
is not well documented by Microsoft. Users should be aware that this may 
cause considerable additional processor overhead, especially with graphics. 
For example, my 486DX/33 typically draws the orthographic map in almost 
half the time when a memory manager is NOT present but the improvement is 
less significant with a 386SX/20:

          Pentium 120 Drawing Time WITHOUT EMM386:    0.88 seconds
          Pentium 120 Drawing Time WITH EMM386:       2.09 seconds

          Pentium 90 Drawing Time WITHOUT EMM386:     1.05 seconds
          Pentium 90 Drawing Time WITH EMM386:        2.80 seconds

          486DX/33 Drawing Time WITHOUT 386MAX:       3.68 seconds
          486DX/33 Drawing Time WITH 386MAX:          6.70 seconds

          386SX/20 Drawing Time WITHOUT QEMM386:     17.91 seconds
          386SX/20 Drawing Time WITH QEMM386:        21.97 seconds
ŠTimes will vary as a function of the satellite position and other program 
features. As the example times above illustrate, the time saving is 
proportionally higher with a faster computer. Note, however, that a memory 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 26


manager may be required for the use of extended or expanded memory and for 
certain applications. The use of different configuration files, selected by 
a batch file or other methods, can optimize performance for various 
applications. DOS 6.2 and higher includes a multiple boot configuration 
facility. I recommend SYSTEM COMMANDER by V Communications, Inc. to select 
multiple boot configurations for DOS, Win311, Win95, and WinNT. Another 
method is to boot the computer from a floppy disk (suitably formatted and 
configured) when the "vanilla" CONFIG.SYS is to be used.
     A notable exception to the performance penalty associated with memory 
managers is NETROOM3 by Helix Software. NETROOM3 uses "cloaking", a memory 
technique becoming more popular and which may soon be used in other memory 
managers. Initial tests of NETROOM3 indicates little or no performance 
penalty as compared to a "vanilla" system with times essentially the same 
as those listed as "WITHOUT EMM386" above. NOTE: NETROOM3 does not appear 
to operate when Adaptec SCSI-2 cards are present!
     Users should also be aware that typical Local Area Network (LAN) 
software, such as NetWare or Lantastic, can impose a performance penalty on 
programs such as STSPLUS. Map drawing times with Lantastic LAN operating 
showed approximately a 20% increase over the same system without the LAN. 
The actual performance will vary as a function of the LAN software used and 
whether the system is configured as a server or as a workstation.
     HIMEM.SYS can still be used to load DOS in high memory even when 
EMM386 or a similar memory manager is not used by just including the 
following lines in CONFIG.SYS:

          DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
          DOS=HIGH

Change the "C:\DOS\" portion of the first line to correspond to the actual 
drive and directory where HIMEM.SYS is located in your system.
     Most systems now provide disk caching which stores recently read disk 
data in high speed Random Access Memory (RAM). While I avoid write caching 
(because it increases the risk of disk corruption in the event of power 
interruption), read caching using a utility such as Microsoft's SMARTDRV 
can all but eliminate disk accesses when STSPLUS is operating. This is 
generally a more effective technique than the older RAM disk approach and 
is usually automatically included in the computer setup. For DOS, Win311, 
and Win95, I recommend the use of Microsoft's SMARTDRV disk caching in the 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file by including the following line:

          SMARTDRV /X

     Memory management is automatic with Windows 95 and Windows NT and 
cannot be disabled. For such systems, optimum STSPLUS performance can be 
obtained by using SMARTDRV as above and setting up the computer for 
multiple operating systems and executing STSPLUS from the DOS operating 
system. Software such as SYSTEM COMMANDER by V Communications may be used 
to select and control multiple operating systems on a single computer.


DOS CONFIG.SYS Setup
--------------------Š
     Users with DOS 5.0 and higher, especially those who take advantage of 
the high memory management capabilities and those who use add-on memory 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 27


managers, should include the following line in their CONFIG.SYS file:

          STACKS=9,256

This command causes DOS to allocate more memory for the internal stacks 
used by DOS and some applications programs. DOS 5.0 seems more sensitive to 
the amount of allocated stack space than were prior DOS versions and 
programs which executed with no problems on DOS 3.3 may fail on DOS 5.0. A 
common symptom of insufficient internal stack space is that STSPLUS 
"freezes" the computer and a reboot is required. Other unpredictable errors 
can also result from stack errors. "9,256" creates 9 stacks of 256 bytes 
each; the "256" may be replaced by "384" or "512", and the "9" may be 
replaced by "15" if the basic STACKS command improves but does not cure the 
problems. See your DOS manual for additional information.


Using STSPLUS on a Local Area Network (LAN)
-------------------------------------------

     Users with a Local Area Network (LAN) can configure STSPLUS so that it 
operates in a "read-only" mode from a network server. This means that the 
main program and all related files can be located in a single server 
directory and individual users will be unable to alter those files if the 
Network Manager sets them to Read-Only status. In particular, the program 
initialization file, STSPLUS.INI, will not be modified or re-written by 
STSPLUS during or after each use (as is normally the case). This allows 
STSPLUS to be pre-configured for the desired location, time zone, 
satellite, etc. and these parameters cannot be altered by users. Note that 
the user is not permitted to update the CITYFILE in "read-only" mode. In 
all other respects the "read-only" mode is identical to normal operation of 
the program.

                               *************
                               *  CAUTION  *
                               *************

          Setting STSPLUS to the "read-only" mode requires that 
          file STSPLUS.INI be modified with an ASCII editor. Word 
          processor users should use the "non-document" mode. 
          Before making changes to file STSPLUS.INI, make a 
          backup copy of STSPLUS.INI in case problems develop. If 
          you are not familiar with text editors, do not attempt 
          these modifications since STSPLUS will NOT operate with 
          a corrupt STSPLUS.INI file!

     In order to cause STSPLUS to operate in the "read-only" mode, file 
STSPLUS.INI must be manually edited (modified). Before modifying the file, 
however, be sure that STSPLUS is configured as desired! The first few lines 
of a typical STSPLUS.INI file contain information similar to the following:

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 28


          0123
          2,"MIR Space Station"
          "Sedona, AZ",-111.7885,34.91533,1311
          "",0,0,0
          "#16609"
          ...

The only item of interest in this case is the first line, "0123" in the 
example above. To set STSPLUS to the "read-only" mode, change that line 
from "0123" to "-0123" (without the quotation marks). The minus sign ("-") 
is the flag that tells STSPLUS to operate in the "read-only" mode. Once set 
in this mode, STSPLUS will no longer update file STSPLUS.INI. Users may 
modify the various program parameters during program execution as usual but 
those changes will NOT be saved. Each time STSPLUS is executed, the same 
initialization data will be used.
     If the program parameters need to be changed or updated, STSPLUS may 
be returned to the normal mode of operation by removing the "-" sign on the 
first line of file STSPLUS.INI, executed to make whatever changes are 
desired (thereby writing an updated version of file STSPLUS.INI), then 
returned to the "read-only" mode by restoring the "-" sign in the first 
line of the file. A new STSPLUS.INI file may also be prepared off-line with 
another copy of STSPLUS (which MUST be the same version number AND use the 
same directory structure!).


Slow Computers and 80x87 Math Coprocessor Chips
-----------------------------------------------

     STSPLUS has been designed for 80386/80387 or better computers equipped 
with an EGA or VGA color display. While the program can be executed on some 
older 8088/8087 (XT-class) or 80286/80287 (AT-class) computers, performance 
is seriously degraded. But it would seem that warnings and suggestions can 
NEVER convince people that their old clunker is past its prime or that the 
calculations required for orbital mechanics and graphics are very complex 
and tax even a powerful computer. The best mainframe computers we had a 
decade or more ago had trouble doing what I now take for granted on a 
personal computer!
     Not all personal computers are created equal. Further, the math 
coprocessor chip can do many of the calculations ten or twenty times faster 
than the main processor. For 80386 computers, this makes a tremendous 
difference AND for a very modest cost, often well under $100. Some users 
report problems with coprocessor chips manufactured by IIT and ULSI; while 
the problems may be related to the computer rather than the coprocessor 
chip, I recommend avoiding coprocessor chips by those manufacturers. 
Finally, I really don't want to hear from users how slow this program runs 
on older machines; I recommend the original STSORBIT if you want the best 
performance from any computer not equipped with a math coprocessor chip.
     STSPLUS always runs as fast as the processor will permit and, since 
most features are available for all computer configurations, it is the 
responsibility of the user to select program features and options 
consistent with the desired performance. For example, the solar terminator 
requires considerable time to perform the required calculations and to Šupdate the display and, if this feature is not required, performance will 
be enhanced if it is disabled.
     As features have been added to STSPLUS, it has become increasingly 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 29


difficult for very slow computers or computers not equipped with a math 
coprocessor to perform the necessary calculations in a reasonable time. 
STSPLUS tests to determine whether or not a math coprocessor chip is 
present and will use it if so. The following table illustrates the 
difference the processor and a math coprocessor chip make:

     Processor   Speed   Coprocessor   Time (secs)
     ---------------------------------------------
     Pentium     90 MHz      YES               2.5
     486DX       33 MHz      YES               6.2
     386DX       20 MHz      YES              12.8
     386SX       20 MHZ      YES              16.8
     386SX       20 MHz       NO              66.0
     286          8 MHz      YES              30.0
     286         12 MHz       NO              86.6
     8088         8 MHz      YES              65.0
     8088         8 MHz       NO             426.4

All systems used MS-DOS in the "typical" configuration for the machine 
under test; a memory manager was present in 386 and higher systems. The 
tests were performed with STSPLUS by measuring the time required from the 
Main Menu until the satellite appeared on the world map display using the 
rectangular map projection. (Not all tests were performed with the same 
version of STSPLUS!) All data were resident in memory (no disk operations 
required). All tests were made using the same display options (most were 
enabled). Slightly better performance can be achieved from the slower 
computers if some options, such as Sun terminator, are disabled. Clearly, 
the 8088 without the math coprocessor chip is not acceptable, and NONE of 
the computers without the math coprocessor chip performs very well. The 
minimum acceptable system requires a 386 processor with coprocessor.
     If, in spite of everything, you insist on using STSPLUS on your old 
clunker, here are a few cautions and reminders.

1.   Especially at startup and when drawing the maps, long time delays can 
     be expected with no math coprocessor -- on the order of minutes in 
     some cases. Status messages are presented on the screen during some 
     (but not all) of these delays. Note also that STSPLUS.EXE is 
     compressed to save disk space and is decompressed at load time; this 
     may cause a noticeable delay on some systems.

2.   Avoid using the orthographic projection with slow computers; the map 
     drawing times are much longer than the rectangular projections. Also 
     avoid high zoom factors since it is possible that the satellite may 
     move during the drawing process to the point where as soon as the 
     display is completed, it's time to redraw the map again. This process 
     will repeat endlessly and a reboot may be required. Restart the 
     program without the "/R" command line option and use F10+F6 from the 
     Main Menu to select WORLD or QUAD maps.

3.   If you have a monochrome monitor, experiment with the "/M" command 
     line option to force monochrome operation. On some monochrome systems 
     the program may otherwise fail with or without an error message. On Š     other monochrome systems, certain colors may not be visible when 
     simulated using shades of gray.

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 30


4.   The original CGA Color Graphics Adapter, even when equipped with a 
     color monitor, can display reasonable graphics (640x320) ONLY in 
     monochrome. Your color CGA monitor buys you nothing for graphics that 
     are quite inferior to the EGA and VGA. Support for CGA and Hercules 
     monitors may be discontinued for future versions of STSPLUS.


Starting Program STSORBIT PLUS and Command Line Options
-------------------------------------------------------

     STSPLUS uses file STSPLUS.INI to save various information required for 
operation. Since the format of that file may change from time to time, 
STSPLUS ignores the file unless it was written by a recent program version. 
If the file does not exist, STSPLUS will automatically create it.
     To start program STSPLUS, enter one of the following commands:

          STSPLUS            Automatic monitor, CGA/HGC/EGA/VGA

          STSPLUS /EGA       Force EGA (or lower) monitor

          STSPLUS /CLK       Use 43 or 60 lines for graphics display of
                             data and large clock characters. NOTE: This
                             feature available with EGA and VGA displays
                             ONLY! It is ignored for CGA/HGC monitors.

          STSPLUS /CGA       Force CGA monitor

          STSPLUS /M         Force monochrome operation, EGA/VGA

          STSPLUS /21        Use 21x21 pixel internal satellite icons
                             rather than the standard 15x15 pixel icons.

          STSPLUS /R         Resume last mission automatically

          STSPLUS /R/SS      Force "screen saver" mode

     Only one display option (/EGA or /CGA) may be used. Other options may 
be combined and entered in any order. For example, using the following 
command will resume the prior mission and force EGA mode:

          STSPLUS /R/EGA

     The first time STSPLUS is run, information is requested for the user's 
location, time zone, and file names and paths. This initialization feature 
may be requested at any time by including the "/NEW" command line option 
alone or in combination with other command line options:

          STSPLUS /NEW

     If you are using a Hercules Graphics Card, run the program MSHERC 
prior to running STSPLUS. This Microsoft program works with compiled BASIC 
programs to enable use of the Hercules Graphics Card. Orthographic Šprojections are NOT supported for Hercules Graphics Cards. One user 
reported that setting the HGC to FULL and selecting Page Zero (using 
software supplied with the HGC) was sufficient for proper operation. At 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 31


least one HGC "clone" user reported that STSPLUS could not be run under any 
circumstances.
     If you have already run STSPLUS and simply wish to resume the prior 
mission, use the /R (resume) command line option:

          STSPLUS /R

STSPLUS will sense the monitor type, enable color for EGA and VGA systems, 
then proceed directly to plotting the mission. The data from the last run, 
as saved in file STSPLUS.INI, is used to initialize the program. Once 
started in this manner, pressing the ENTER key after the map is displayed 
will return to the Main Menu.
     The special command line option "/R/SS", used after you have already 
run STSPLUS, forces the "screen saver" mode:

          STSPLUS /R/SS

In this mode, available only with EGA and VGA monitors, the program 
displays the orthographic globe with ground track and other selected 
display features but NO DATA. Using the orthographic globe, the screen 
changes frequently EXCEPT that the satellite icon remains always centered 
on the map and the circle outlining the globe is always drawn (which may 
eventually cause phosphor burns in those areas). To return to DOS, press 
ENTER or ESC.
     Several additional command line options are available to control 
certain map display features. These may be included in addition to the 
command line options above.

     +L   Include Location and Feature Labels
     -L   Exclude Location and Feature Labels
     +R   Include Rivers and Lakes
     -R   Exclude Rivers and Lakes
     +T   Include Tracking Stations
     -T   Exclude Tracking Stations
     +V   Include Local Circle of Visibility
     -V   Exclude Local Circle of Visibility

These command line options are useful in the "screen saver" mode, with 
batch files, and for operations when no operator is present. When a feature 
is enabled or disabled with these command line options, the new status of 
the feature is saved for subsequent uses. For example, the following 
command line could be used in "screen saver" mode for a "minimum" display:

          STSPLUS /R/SS-L-R-V

and normal use would be invoked with:

          STSPLUS /R+L+R+V

Predicting Visible Satellite Passes
-----------------------------------

     One of the most popular uses for a satellite tracking program is to 
show when a satellite of interest will be visible from a specified 
location. Using STSPLUS, my wife and I have spotted four different Space 
Shuttle missions, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Russian MIR Space 
Station, and many others with the naked eye. The trick, of course, is 
knowing when and where to look for the satellite.
     During normal operation, STSPLUS displays two timers in the form of 
countdown clocks (Minutes:Seconds), "AOS" and "LOS", for the user's 
location (as well as for a number of other events).  AOS, Acquisition of 
Signal, is the time remaining until the satellite is next within the circle 
of visibility. LOS, Loss of Signal, is the time remaining until the 
satellite next passes outside the circle of visibility. STSPLUS looks ahead 
four hours (240 minutes) from the time the map is drawn to determine the 
next AOS and LOS event; the clocks are blank if the time is greater than 
240 minutes. A quick inspection of these clocks can therefore determine if 
a potentially visible pass is upcoming within four hours.
     Using its internal pass prediction feature, STSPLUS can look ahead 
in 48 hour blocks and list the passes when the selected satellite will 
be within the local circle of visibility (line-of-sight, no lighting 
constraints applied), line-of-sight passes with horizon constraints, and 
visible passes with horizon and lighting constraints.


Predicting Satellite Passes with STSPLUS
----------------------------------------

     STSPLUS has a pass prediction capability to make tabular visible and 
line-of-sight pass predictions for the current satellite quick and easy. 
Once a satellite has been selected (with F2 from the Main Menu) and 
displayed on the tracking map, pressing F3 from the Main Menu, and 
selecting Data Format 9 (Pass Predictions) will quickly produce a listing 
of the passes for that satellite over the next 48 hour period. Visible 
passes during that time period, if any, are specially flagged. Pass 
predictions start approximately 10 minutes to the current real or simulated 
time in order to include passes in progress. See the section "Pass 
Predictions and Data Output" for additional information.
     Three types of passes may be calculated: All passes, Line-of-Sight 
passes, and Visible passes. Which pass type is to be calculated is selected 
during the setup if "N" is pressed in response to the prompt "Accept 
parameters (Y,n,s,x)" when the pass is requested using F3 from the Main 
Menu. The "All passes" option is the same as that present in STSPLUS for 
Versions 9548 and before. For Line-of-Sight and Visible passes, the pass 
duration must be greater than 10 seconds or the pass will be ignored. A 
single text line appears at the top of the screen describing the pass type. 
When output is directed to file STSPLUS.LOG, to LPT1, or COM1/COM2, the 
screen header is replaced by a section of text which describes the various 
pass parameters. 
     The following examples are for the same time period for the Russian 
MIR Space Station. "All passes" lists each pass which comes above the Šuser's horizon by even a fractional degree. "Line-of-Sight passes" lists 
each pass which achieves the specified minimum altitude ("MinAlt", set to 5 
degrees in the example) and gives the times from a specified altitude above 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 33


the user's horizon ("MinHor", set to 3 degrees in the example). "Visible 
passes" lists each Line-of-Sight pass which is also visible and gives the 
times of visibility and maximum altitude. Note the differences in the 
passes listed and in the various times in the examples.

     The examples shown above have been calculated for Pacific Standard 
Time ("PST"); the user may select Local Time (with the appropriate 
abbreviation automatically supplied) or Coordinated Universal Time ("UTC") 
during the setup process. Color (on color monitors only) is used to 
highlight each of the major sections of the Pass Prediction display:

AOS       Light Green    The time and date listed is when the satellite 
                         "breaks the horizon" for the user's primary 
                         location. "Azm" gives the Azimuth for the 
                         satellite's rise in the sense NESW. The satellite 
                         is NOT visible at this time.

          White          (All passes ONLY) Same as above except the 
                         satellite IS visible, weather permitting, and more 
                         than five degrees above the horizon at the start 
                         of the pass.

MAX VIS   Light Cyan     The time listed is when the satellite reaches its Š                         maximum altitude or elevation ("Alt") for the 
                         user's primary location and that altitude is 
                         greater than the current maximum altitude. "Azm"

                         gives the Azimuth in the sense NESW.

          Cyan           Same as above except the maximum altitude is less 
                         than the current maximum altitude.

          Bright White   (All passes ONLY) The time listed is as above AND 
                         the satellite is visible at an altitude greater 
                         than the current maximum altitude.

          White          (All passes ONLY) The time listed is as above and 
                         the satellite may be visible but the maximum 
                         altitude is less than the current maximum 
                         altitude.

LOS       Light Red      The time listed is when the satellite sets. "Azm" 
                         gives the Azimuth in the sense NESW. The satellite 
                         is NOT visible at this time.

          White          (All passes ONLY) Same as above except the 
                         satellite IS visible, weather permitting, at the 
                         end of the pass.

DURATION  Yellow         This time, given as "h:mm:ss", represents the 
                         total time the satellite is above the user's 
                         horizon or meets the visibility criteria for 
                         the current pass mode.

VIS:      Bright White   (Visible passes ONLY) The times given in this line 
                         are the actual times the satellite may be visible 
                         to the naked eye or binoculars. The full pass 
                         times are given in the first line for the pass.

As used here, "visible" means that the satellite is lit by the Sun and the 
user's primary location is in darkness (before sunrise or after sunset). 
Actual visibility depends upon the the physical characteristics of the 
satellite (size, presence of large solar panels, etc.), the weather and the 
geometry of the pass. Since the satellite is seen by reflected light from 
the Sun, best viewing usually occurs when the Sun is behind the viewer when 
looking toward the satellite. Since most visible passes occur near sunrise 
or sunset, the satellite may pass into the Earth's shadow during the pass 
and quickly disappear.
     Here are some comments and suggestions for satellite viewing and 
tracking with STSPLUS.

1.   The pass predictions are listed in blocks of 48 hours beginning with 
     the current real or simulated time, and are given an arbitrary pass 
     number from 1 to 99. The data include the "AOS" or Acquisition of 
     Signal when the satellite rises above the local horizon, "MAX 
     VISIBILITY" or the time at which the satellite reaches the highest 
     altitude above the local horizon, "LOS" or Loss of Signal when the 
     satellite sets below the local horizon, and "Duration" or the total 
     time the satellite is above the local horizon. The conditions for Š     "AOS" and "LOS" may be modified for maximum altitude and minimum 
     altitude above the user's horizon in the Line-of-Sight and Visible 
     pass modes.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 36



2.   In the All passes mode, passes for which the satellite may be visible 
     for some or all of the pass are colored in WHITE and the "V" (for 
     Visible) column at right is flagged with a flashing asterisk. Note 
     that "local horizon" means the true horizon rather than local terrain. 
     For either visual or electronic tracking, the altitude above the true 
     local horizon when the satellite may actually be seen or tracked is 
     usually at least three or four degrees even under optimum conditions 
     with even the most sophisticated equipment.

     CAUTION: Users with slow computers, especially those without a math 
     coprocessor, will find that pass predictions may require considerable 
     time -- up to tens of minutes using a slow 286 without a 287!

3.   Be sure to use current orbital elements for the satellite. My WWW Home 
     Page has current 2-line orbital elements for about 1500 satellites and 
     these data are also available from other electronic sources. For Low 
     Earth Orbit satellites like the Space Shuttle or MIR, orbital elements 
     should be no more than about ten days old, more recent if the 
     satellite may be maneuvering; for higher orbit satellites, orbital 
     elements remain accurate for longer periods, up to about 30 days. 
     Satellite maneuvers can radically change the orbital elements. Pass 
     predictions can be no more accurate than the orbital elements used!

4.   Examine the "Alt" (maximum altitude or elevation in degrees above the 
     true horizon) given under the "MAX VISIBILITY" columns for each pass 
     and select a suitable pass. As a general rule, the higher the maximum 
     altitude, the better the visibility. If you wish to see a particular 
     pass as a ground track display, enter the pass number and STSPLUS will 
     set simulated time to about 30 seconds prior to the time of maximum 
     visibility and prepare the display. Press "L" while the ground track 
     is displayed to use the Location Map centered on your location with 
     the "bulls-eye" concentric circles of equal altitude. You may 
     stop/pause the display by pressing Function Key F6, then move the 
     satellite forward or backward in time using the "+" and "-" keys and 
     adjust the time step (1, 10, or 60 seconds) with Function Key F4. 
     Press ENTER to resume normal (simulated time) operation.

5.   In the All passes mode, STSPLUS lists all passes where the satellite 
     rises above the local true horizon and flags all passes which may be 
     visible, those passes for which the satellite is in sunlight and the 
     user's location is in darkness. Visible passes are marked in WHITE and 
     flagged in the far right column with a flashing asterisk. A satellite 
     may be visible for only a portion of a pass, in which case not all 
     items may be marked in white. In this context, a "visible pass" means 
     "visible to the naked eye or with binoculars". Although there are 
     exceptions in unusual situations, this generally restricts the times 
     for visible passes to the several hours prior to local dawn and the 
     several hours after local sunset. (Note, however, that "visible" to a 
     ham radio operator or radar tracking station simply means above the 
     horizon, usually by at least three or four degrees.) In most cases, 
     the Space Shuttle and satellites such as MIR Space Station and Hubble Š     Space Telescope are visible with the naked eye given favorable 
     lighting and weather conditions. Satellites in higher altitude orbits 
     will be visible sooner before dawn and longer after sunset. Satellites 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 37


     in very high orbits, no matter how large the satellite, are seldom 
     visible without high power binoculars or a telescope. Dates and times 
     may be given in either Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or local time. 

6.   The geometry of the pass and the attitude and geometry of the 
     spacecraft are also important in determining visibility. The relative 
     angles between the Sun, the satellite, and the viewer determine how 
     light is reflected from the surfaces of the spacecraft to you, the 
     viewer. A spacecraft passing between you and the Sun may not reflect 
     much light to you and may therefore not be visible even at higher 
     altitudes. On the other hand, a spacecraft nearer the horizon but on 
     the other side of you from the Sun may appear brilliantly lighted. The 
     kinds of surfaces on the spacecraft are important too; solar panels 
     and flat surfaces can reflect enough light to appear the most 
     brilliant objects in the sky while larger but rounded spacecraft may 
     seem all but invisible.

7.   Given otherwise good conditions and favorable weather, the single most 
     important factor is spacecraft apparent altitude ("Alt") during a 
     pass. This is the spacecraft's apparent altitude (elevation) above 
     your local horizon. Depending upon local conditions, an altitude of at 
     least 5 to 10 degrees will generally be necessary before a spacecraft 
     can be seen even under the best lighting conditions. In the Los 
     Angeles area, at least 20 degrees is a better number to use because of 
     smog, haze and light pollution (except when looking out over the 
     Pacific Ocean).

8.   The azimuth ("Azm") is the angle in degrees which describes the 
     direction from the viewer to the spacecraft at any moment. This is 
     given in the sense NESW, North to East to South to West; North is 0 
     degrees, East is 90 degrees, etc. For a good visible pass after 
     sunset, for example, an azimuth ranging from 60 to 150 degrees would 
     indicate a pass moving generally from the Northeast to the Southeast, 
     ideal lighting conditions with the Sun in the West.

9.   Remember that STSPLUS automatically sets SIMULATED TIME when using the 
     pass prediction feature to display passes. If simulated time is 
     already in effect, pass predictions start from the current simulated 
     time and a new simulated time is automatically set for a selected 
     pass. Once set, simulated time remains in effect until changed by 
     selecting another pass or until reset with F8 from the Main Menu. To 
     return to "real time", press F8+F1 from the Main Menu. The Main Menu 
     displays the current time with the time mode in effect labeled as 
     "Current Time" or "Simulated Time".


Predicting Satellite Passes with TRAKSTAR
-----------------------------------------

     In order to generate detailed tabular predictions for satellite 
passes, an external program may also be used. I recommend two programs for 
this purpose: Paul Traufler's TRAKSAT and TS Kelso's TRAKSTAR. Each Šprograms is copyrighted by the respective author and is readily available. 
They are both fine programs and set a standard against which other 
satellite tracking programs are measured for performance and accuracy.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 38


     I have selected TRAKSTAR as the default external program used with 
STSPLUS for two reasons: first, the program quickly produces very accurate 
tabular data without graphics; and second, TRAKSTAR requires minimum memory 
and is easily configured for seamless operation with STSPLUS. TRAKSTAR is 
available on Kelso's Home Page (below) and from my home page.
     TRAKSAT is a very large program with many features. In order to run 
TRAKSAT, users must first exit STSPLUS (press "ESC" from the Main Menu).
     For additional information on these programs and orbital data, contact 
the authors:

As a courtesy to the author, I suggest enclosing a stamped, self-addressed 
envelope if you write and request a reply. Inquiries via E-Mail are usually 
answered promptly. The current version of each program is always posted on 
the indicated Internet site.
     There is no "standard" filetype used for 2-line elements files; 
typical filetypes in regular use are ".TXT", ".TLE", ".N2L", and ".ELE"; 
some files also include comment lines, multi-line commentary, or additional 
data, some or all of which must be removed prior to use with most satellite 
tracking programs. As released by Dr. Kelso, TRAKSTAR expects a filetype of 
".TLE" and cannot accept any other filetype without being re-compiled. 
STSPLUS defaults to both filetype ".TXT" and ".TLE". TRAKSAT defaults to 
filetype ".TXT" only. However, 2-line elements files may use either ".TLE" 
or ".TXT", depending upon the file. For the past four or five years, Paul 
Traufler and I have been jointly releasing file TLEnnn.TXT (usually 
compressed as file TLEnnn.ZIP, where "nnn" is a number like "143"). This 
file is a sorted concatenation of TLE files from TS Kelso (using my program 
ORBITEL) and currently includes 2-line elements for some 900+ satellites. 
TLEs from GSFC/Orbital Information Group are posted as file GSFCnnn.ZIP.
     STSPLUS solves the filetype problem with TRAKSTAR by dynamically 
creating a file called STSPLUS.TLE which contains the 2-line elements for 
the currently selected satellite. Since STSPLUS can select 2-line elements 
from a file of any size, calling TRAKSTAR through STSPLUS also circumvents 
a minor problem in the current version of TRAKSTAR which limits the number 
of satellites in a 2-line elements file to 250 element sets. As a 
convenience, STSPLUS also dynamically creates the files STSPLUS.OBS (which 
contains the name, coordinates, and elevation of the current user location) 
and TRAKSTAR.CFG (which contains the drive and path information as well as 
the current UTC Offset for TRAKSTAR).Š     An accurate elevation (above mean sea level) for the user location is 
required for accurate calculations in any satellite tracking program, 
including STSPLUS, TRAKSTAR, and TRAKSAT. Note that the elevations of some
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 39


locations in file STSPLUS.CTY were not available and have been set to zero. 
The elevation is the last parameter on each line in file STSPLUS.CTY and is 
given in integer meters; 1 meter equals 3.28083 feet.
     STSPLUS is coded to operate with TRAKSTAR Version 2.65. It may or may 
not operate correctly with other versions. Versions prior to 2.65 may be 
incompatible or have Y2K problems. To set up program TRAKSTAR either for 
independent use or for use with STSPLUS, follow the following steps:

1.   Copy the TRAKSTAR files to your hard disk. Unpack the files if they 
     are contained in an archive file such as TRAKSTR2.ZIP. I recommend 
     using a separate directory called "TRAKSTAR". The complete TRAKSTAR 
     package includes documentation, Pascal source, example and test files, 
     and the program itself. The following two files are required for 
     operation with STSPLUS:

          TRAKSTAR.EXE        Main Program
          TRAKSTAR.HDR        Header File

     Additional files are required for independent operation. Read the 
     TRAKSTAR documentation for details.

2.   Run STSPLUS and enter the drive and path information for TRAKSTAR by 
     pressing F7+F5 (Set FILENAMES and PATHS) from the Main Menu. STSPLUS 
     will automatically default to its own drive and directory if you omit 
     this step.

3.   Select the desired 2-line elements file and satellite by pressing F2 
     from the Main Menu.

4.   When the map is on the screen and you have verified that the correct 
     satellite is being tracked, press ENTER to return to the Main Menu.

5.   Now press F4 from the Main Menu to run TRAKSTAR. You should 
     immediately see TRAKSTAR's opening screen and the first selection. 
     Make the various selections by using the up and down arrow keys to 
     move between selections and press ENTER when you have the correct 
     selection. Don't forget to press SPACE to select the satellite! 

     NOTE: Unlike earlier releases of STSPLUS, TRAKSTAR is executed 
     directly and NOT via the "shell" command. TRAKSTAR Version 2.65 uses 
     the DOS clock to determine the default start and stop times for its 
     calculations. 

6.   TRAKSTAR will now make its calculations and write the results to a 
     file. The file is written in the TRAKSTAR directory and will overwrite 
     an existing file of the same name. The time required will be a 
     function of the time span and time interval requested as well as the 
     calculation speed of your computer. Read the TRAKSTAR documentation 
     carefully so that you will recognize the name of the file that 
     TRAKSTAR writes. For example, requesting visible passes for the Hubble 
     Space Telescope (NORAD #20830) will result in a filename of "VOB20830" 
     and a filetype which is the last three digits of the element set Š     number (such as ".866").

7.   As soon as TRAKSTAR finishes, you will be at a DOS prompt in the 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 40


     TRAKSTAR directory if STSPLUS was executed from a DOS prompt. To 
     return to STSPLUS's Main Menu, change back to the STSPLUS directory, 
     enter "STSPLUS" and resume normal operations. If you are using 
     Win95/98/NT, type "EXIT" to return to your desktop if that does not 
     occur automatically, then execute STSPLUS or examine the files just 
     generated by TRAKSTAR.

If STSPLUS cannot find TRAKSTAR.EXE in the selected directory, an error 
message will be displayed. Press ENTER to continue.


Printing Graphics Screens
-------------------------

     Many users have requested that I add a "print screen" function to 
STSPLUS. Given the number and variety of printers available and the fact 
that I only have a couple of printers I can use for testing, this is not 
practical within STSPLUS. STSPLUS includes the "*" command which may be 
executed while the map is displayed to create a .PCX graphics file; a 
graphics program such as Paint Shop Pro may then be used to view and/or 
print the image.
     For direct screen printing, DOS includes the GRAPHICS command which 
may be used with many computers to enable printing of graphics images. 
Check your DOS and printer manuals for details. As an example, I use the 
following command on systems equipped with a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet II or 
III:

          GRAPHICS LASERJETII

     There are also quite a number of screen capture and print screen 
programs, both commercial and shareware, which can perform this task. Note, 
however, that all these programs are TSR's (Terminate and Stay Resident) 
and some could interfere with STSPLUS's operation.
     Some print screen programs, including DOS's built-in GRAPHICS command, 
do not render colors very well. Certain colors may not be visible on the 
printed copy at all. For such programs, use the "/M" command line option to 
force monochrome operation when you wish to print graphics images from the 
screen.


Known STSPLUS Problems and Bugs
-------------------------------

     STSPLUS is being used on thousands of computers around the world 
without any significant problems. However, like almost any computer program 
and in spite of my best efforts, there are several known problems or "bugs" 
with STSPLUS. Some are the result of slow computers, others are in the 
program itself. Hopefully, some or all of these problems, those I can 
reproduce at least, will be repaired in due course. Some problems are 
caused by other software interfering with the program's operation. Still 
other problems are the result of incompatible "IBM-compatible" computers 
for which there is no remedy.Š     One "problem" which I occasionally still hear about is that a user's 
CGA color monitor only displays STSPLUS in monochrome. THIS IS NOT A BUG! 
CGA systems display "high resolution" 640 x 200 graphics in monochrome 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 41


ONLY. Compared to the EGA or VGA, that resolution is not really acceptable; 
the so-called "color graphics mode" for the CGA is only 320 x 200 which is 
inadequate for STSPLUS. Because of the poor performance of the CGA display, 
some program features are NOT available. Support for the CGA and HGC 
display may be discontinued completely in the future.

1.   STSORBIT PLUS has been run extensively on systems using Microsoft DOS 
     3.3 through 6.22 and there are no known problems with those operating 
     systems EXCEPT the STACKS problem with DOS 5.0 (see the section 
     Program Setup and Usage Notes above). Testing indicates that 
     performance is acceptable using Windows 95 when restarted with the MS-
     DOS prompt (but often not from within Windows 95). Operation with 
     Windows 3.1 is acceptable when STSPLUS is run FULL SCREEN.

     Because of the many bugs reported, I do NOT recommend use of DOS 4.xx 
     under any circumstances; upgrade ASAP to DOS 6.2! Many users report 
     good performance using IBM OS/2, Version 2.1; earlier versions of OS/2 
     are NOT recommended. Users report memory allocation problems with some 
     early versions of Digital Research DRDOS 6.0 and certain third party 
     memory allocation programs. A typical symptom of this kind of problem 
     is that when you attempt to return to DOS, you receive an error 
     message or the computer freezes.

2.   Some math coprocessor chips fail to execute STSPLUS and similar 
     programs correctly. In at least two reported cases, early 387SX math 
     coprocessor chips from IIT generated random errors; when notified of 
     the problem, ITT replaced the suspect chips and the problems 
     disappeared. Reports indicate that USLI 387SX chips do not operate 
     correctly with STSPLUS or TRAKSAT; Intel or Cyrix 387SX chips have 
     always cured the problems. No problems have been reported for Intel or 
     Cyrix chips.

3.   Note that not all computers (especially older CGA systems) will 
     display the extended graphics characters used for the large clock 
     characters (selected with F2 when the map is displayed). The symptom 
     of this problem is that the lower left portion of the data block is 
     mostly blank after pressing F2. If you have this problem and your 
     computer is running DOS 3.x or higher, enter the command "GRAFTABL" 
     at the DOS prompt before running STSPLUS or include the line 
     "GRAFTABL" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file; this sets the "code page" to 
     enable the computer to display the extended graphics characters. [The 
     program GRAFTABL.COM is usually included as part of DOS.]

4.   Some users report problems with certain Terminate and Stay Resident 
     (TSR) programs for which the only remedy is to remove the offending 
     TSR. This usually requires a "trial and error" approach to pinpoint 
     the TSR causing the problem. The best method is to remove ALL such 
     programs from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, including "DOSSHELL", to make 
     sure the program will work with your computer in the simplest possible 
     configuration. Similarly, delete all special memory and device drivers 
     from your CONFIG.SYS file. For DOS 5.0 and higher, add the line 
     "STACKS=9,256" to your CONFIG.SYS file. In some cases it may be Š     necessary to increase the number "256" to "384" or "512". One user 
     reported a problem on an IBM PS/2 when a mouse driver was used (but I 
     regularly execute STSPLUS with my mouse active!).
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 42



5.   LCD displays, such as are found on most laptops, have fixed scan line 
     positions (unlike the variable scan modes available with CRT 
     displays). The standard 640x480 VGA STSPLUS display may not occupy the 
     full LCD screen. Similarly, the EGA emulation used in the STSPLUS 
     Motion Maps may use only 350 of the available scan lines and the image 
     will be compressed vertically. An alternate solution to VGA and EGA 
     emulation used by some manufacturers is to repeat (double) some scan 
     lines; this can result in peculiar display artifacts such as double-
     thick horizontal and vertical lines at certain screen locations. The 
     solution to this dilemma varies by laptop manufacturer; check 
     your laptop's manual for possible display options.

6.   Even with CRT monitors, all VGA adapter cards are not equal -- just in 
     case any of you had some illusions left. In at least one case, the 
     aspect ratio of the CRT display is incorrect when the display is 
     operated in the EGA simulation mode. The vertical scale is compressed 
     by about 20% as compared to either a true EGA display or other VGA 
     adapter cards. Many monitors have a vertical size adjustment for each 
     monitor mode that will correct the problem. Some current video adapter 
     cards do not correctly emulate EGA mode and the Motion Map fails. 

7.   Several users have reported "bugs" with the local Circle of Visibility 
     and the ZOE (Zone of Exclusion) when displaying satellites with 
     relatively high eccentricity. This is NOT a bug, rather it's a problem 
     with the orbit. STSPLUS determines the local coverage and ZOE based 
     upon the satellite altitude at the instant the map is drawn and these 
     map features are updated only when the map is redrawn. For a satellite 
     with a high eccentricity (such as RS-10, NORAD #18129, a popular 
     amateur radio satellite), the diameter of the local Circle of 
     Visibility can change considerably over relatively short time periods 
     especially when the satellite is near perigee. Likewise, TDRS coverage 
     will be continuous near apogee and hence no ZOE. When the map is 
     redrawn nearer perigee, coverage will not be continuous and a ZOE will 
     be shown. To minimize this effect, press the "R" key as the satellite 
     approaches a point or time of interest; this will cause the map to be 
     redrawn with current data. As an aside, the TDRS system is NOT used 
     with such satellites!

8.   The map database used with STSPLUS originated with the CIA quite some 
     years ago (early 1980's). Certain islands in Northern Canada were 
     included as lakes and required special processing to cause them to 
     appear correctly. Several islands in the South Pacific are misdrawn or 
     are missing entirely; Fiji and Western Samoa are examples 
     respectively. Most very small islands were intentionally omitted to 
     reduce the size of the database. I have a more recent version of the 
     map database but the current files are large and distribution of the 
     current version is so widespread that changing the database presents 
     major problems. For the present, I plan to continue with the current 
     database files, errors notwithstanding.

9.   Several users have reported that their computer "freezes" at midnight Š     local time when running STSPLUS. I have been unable to duplicate the 
     problem and one user reports that this "day change bug" may be a 
     problem in the computer's BIOS. Contact the manufacturer for 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 43


     information and/or an update.

10.  Finally, as noted elsewhere, all computers are NOT equal. There are a 
     few (usually older) computers which will not execute STSPLUS under any 
     circumstances. Tandy is the most common offender followed by Leading 
     Edge. Some models from these and other manufacturers have BIOS 
     problems or errors which prevent programs compiled with the Microsoft 
     BASIC compilers from operating (sometimes only in graphics modes). 
     There is no remedy. Other computers, Ergo for example, exhibit 
     "strange" behavior in some graphics and text modes. There may be an 
     update or workaround available for these problems; check with the 
     computer manufacturer.

STSPLUS MAP PROJECTIONS AND DATABASES
-------------------------------------

     Cartographers and navigators have long wrestled with the problem of 
map projections, the process of transferring location information from a 
sphere to a flat surface or map. The U.S. Geological Survey publishes "An 
Album of Map Projections", Professional Paper 1453, that contains some 90 
basic projections in over 130 different modifications and aspects. Each 
projection or modification was developed to serve some specific need or to 
optimize certain parameters. The primary concern with any map projection is 
distortion. For STSPLUS, this means the accuracy with which the selected 
portion of the Earth's surface is displayed. Naturally, the viewer desires 
accuracy in area, shape, and distance; unfortunately, you can't have all 
three simultaneously with a single map projection.
     The cylindrical or rectangular projection, used here and with the 
original STSORBIT program, is a good compromise where drawing time is to 
be minimized. The map coordinate data translate exactly to screen pixels 
with a minimum of computer processing. However, this projection is unable 
to display the polar regions well; the distortion increases non-linearly as 
the latitude increases. I have chosen to limit the latitude to plus and 
minus 85 degrees to avoid some of the severe problems which occur very near 
the poles. As the magnification is increased, the distortion inherent in 
this projection is reduced for the area shown but different latitudes are 
displayed at different scales for a given magnification. A satellite 
appears to move more rapidly in high latitudes than at mid or equatorial 
latitudes.
     The orthographic projection views the world as a sphere and thus only 
a single hemisphere can be seen at any given time. However, since the map 
center may be placed at any desired point, the "hemisphere" may include a 
pole. The projection is calculated as if the viewer were at a great 
distance from the Earth and therefore can see a complete hemisphere. This 
makes the projection ideal for viewing high inclination satellite orbits. 
Perspective is not included in the projection calculations for simplicity. 
The orthographic projection has the advantage that ANY area of the Earth 
may be viewed, including the poles, and the scale remains the same for any 
given magnification and is independent of the area viewed. At the center of 
the map, circles of visibility appear as true circles; however, area 
distortion increases toward the edge of the screen and is especially 
noticeable when the full hemisphere is displayed.
     The map databases used for STSPLUS are an adaptation of the Micro 
World Database II ("WDB"), generously placed in the public domain by Peter 
Pospeschil and Antonio Riveria, and were produced in about 1986. The 
original data were from the U. S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as 
distributed by the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). There are 
several known errors in the database: one island in the South Pacific is 
missing its northwestern portion, and several islands near the North Pole 
are classified as "lakes" instead of "islands" (an error which STSPLUS 
corrects). There are also numerous gaps in coastlines which make color fill 
very difficult over the range of magnifications used here.
     The original map data are identified by "level of detail" with Level 1 
having the greatest detail and Level 5 having the least detail. I have 
elected to use Levels 1 through 4 for STSPLUS; Level 5 is so coarse as to Šbe almost useless. I have also written several utility programs to extract 
the map coordinate data from the original WDB files by level of detail and 
to build an index file for each level to speed access to the data. For the 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 45


orthographic projection, the data are also converted from latitude and 
longitude to geocentric Cartesian coordinates to minimize subsequent 
processing time. Although the resulting map database files are 
substantially smaller than the original data files, they are still quite 
large for the higher levels of detail; for example, the Level 1 files 
require approximately 1.5MB.
     STSPLUS attempts to select the map database files appropriate to a 
given magnification and map projection. If the selected level is not 
present, the program tries the next lower level until the selection process 
reaches Level 4, the lowest level of detail. The Level 4 map database files 
are required for operation of the program and are included in the standard 
program distribution. The Level 3 map database files are included with 
program registration and are available separately on my WWW Home Page. The 
Level 2 and Level 1 map database files are available separately to 
registered users; see file README for registration and donation 
information.
     The structure of the map database files is the same for all levels of 
detail and the index file (filetype .MCX) is the same size in each case. 
STSPLUS cannot distinguish between levels except by file names. Thus, if 
you are using a high speed computer such as a Pentium, you may rename the 
files to force STSPLUS to use a higher level of detail for a given zoom 
or magnification factor. All three files (.MCX, .MCP, and .XYZ) for a 
particular level must be kept together with the same filename or chaos will 
result! STSPLUS requires Level 4 to be present and expects no gaps in 
the other levels present. Naturally, drawing times will be increased as the 
price of the improved detail.

Satellite Name Cross-Reference using STSPLUS.XRF
------------------------------------------------

     STSPLUS can perform satellite name cross-references using file 
STSPLUS.XRF. Each time TLEs are read and accepted, STSPLUS checks for the 
cross-reference file and, if the file is present in the current directory, 
checks for the NORAD Number of the satellite and a cross-reference name. If 
found, the new name is substituted for that in the TLE file. The XRF file 
is standard ASCII and may be created and/or edited with a standard ASCII 
editor. Word processor users must use the "non-document" mode. Each entry 
consists of a SPACE, the five-digit NORAD Number, a SPACE, and then the 
satellite name. A sample file:

 22920 HST Solar Array
 22076 Topex/Poseidon
 21225 Gamma Ray Observ
 20638 Rosat Observatory
 20580 Hubble Telescope
 16609 MIR Space Station

NOTE: The leading space shown above is required for file compatibility with 
XRF files used with my program ORBITEL (but is optional for STSPLUS). The 
NORAD Number MUST be 5 digits; pad with leading zeroes if necessary.

     Only one entry is read per satellite; the search stops with the first 
match of NORAD Numbers. There is no limit on the number of entries, but 
larger files with many entries may introduce a slight delay as the file is 
read. If the satellite name is longer than 19 characters, only the first 19 
characters of the name will be used because of space restrictions on the 
display. Since the name substitution is unconditional, care should be taken 
to enter the correct NORAD Number for the named satellite; if in doubt, use 
F2 from the Main Menu to request orbital data by the NORAD Number (enter 
"#nnnnn" for the satellite name) to inspect the data and to verify that it 
is the correct satellite.
     This feature may be used to substitute a preferred name for that given 
in a TLE file (which may not always be consistent from source to source) or 
to specify the name of a payload piggy-backed on another satellite (as is 
frequently the case with amateur radio transponders). In the example above, 
"Hubble Telescope" is substituted for "HST", the satellite name usually 
present in TLE files for NORAD Number 20580. A number of XRF files are 
posted on my WWW Home Page; such files must be renamed STSPLUS.XRF before 
use with STSPLUS.

Preparing 2-Line Elements using VEC2TLE by Ken Ernandes
-------------------------------------------------------

     Especially for Space Shuttle missions, Earth-Centered Inertial ("ECI") 
cartesian state vectors may be the only orbital information available in 
near real time. Such a state vector, consisting of position and velocity 
data at a specified time, is sufficient to determine the instantaneous 
orbit of a satellite. NASA and other agencies may provide state vectors 
referenced to the mean equator and equinox of the Besselian year 1950 
("M50", "Mean of 1950", or "B1950") with units of measure in feet and feet 
per second. Data may also be available for the true equator and equinox of 
date (such as the state vectors generated by STSPLUS), the mean equator and 
equinox of the Julian year 2000 ("J2000"), or in the time-independent 
Earth-Fixed Greenwich ("EFG") coordinate systems. Kilometers or nautical 
miles or variations may also be used as the units of measure.
     However, STSPLUS and most other satellite tracking programs require 
orbital data in the "2-Line Elements" or "TLE" format and state vectors 
must be converted to that format before the data may be used. The 2-Line 
format originated as 2-Card Elements back in the days of IBM punched cards 
at NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command, now US Space Command), 
and has become the de facto standard format for orbital data used with 
satellite tracking software.
     Mr. Kenneth J. Ernandes has written program VEC2TLE, Vector to Two 
Line Elements, specifically to convert state vectors to the 2-line format. 
VEC2TLE is copyrighted software distributed as shareware, and registration 
is required prior to regular use. Mr. Ernandes has extensive experience in 
orbital mechanics with US Space Command and in industry, and has used his 
expertise to create a precision conversion program. For additional 
information and registration details, write:

          Internet:    70511.3107@cis.com

When writing Mr. Ernandes for information, I suggest including a stamped 
self-addressed envelope as a courtesy. The current version of VEC2TLE is 
usually posted on my WWW Home Page.
     Note that although 2-line elements can be generated using only the 
data in an ECI state vector and these elements will yield an accurate 
position at the specified time, the "epoch" of the data, additional data 
(in particular, Drag and B-Star parameters) are required to generate 2-line 
elements which propagate accurately over time. Certain additional 
parameters, such as element set number and orbit number, do NOT affect the 
accuracy of the propagated position; these data may be obtained from other 
sources or default values may be used. US Space Command assigns a Catalog 
Number, often referred to as the "NORAD Number", some time after launch; 
pre-launch elements for Space Shuttle missions may have a temporary Catalog
Number (corresponding to the mission number) until the actual Catalog 
Number is assigned. The International Designation is assigned by COSPAS at Šthe time a launch is registered by the launching country and may be blank. 
Element set ("ElSet") numbers are assigned arbitrarily by the originating 
individual or agency and have no effect on the orbital data. Orbit (or 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 48


revolution or "REV") numbers are incremented on each revolution at the 
ascending node, the point at which a orbit crosses the equator heading 
North. Note that US Space Command does not usually use the same reference 
for orbit numbers as does NASA; NASA defines the first partial orbit as 
"Rev 1" whereas US Space Command may call that "Rev 0" or some other 
arbitrary number. At least for Space Shuttle missions, it is common 
practice to adjust USSPACECOM orbit numbers to conform to the NASA 
convention.
     VEC2TLE accepts all data required to form a complete 2-line orbital 
element set, either as manually entered data or from a properly formatted 
vector input file, performs limited error checking on these data, then 
displays and writes the generated 2-line elements file. VEC2TLE supports 
STSPLUS Data Mode 5 through 7 state vector formats. The program also 
supports a variety of coordinate systems, units of measure, and time 
formats as well as offering many other useful features.
     Care must be taken when using VEC2TLE that the proper units of measure 
(kilometers, feet, or nautical miles), coordinate system (ECI or EFG), and 
epoch (True of Date, Mean of 1950, etc.) are used. See the VEC2TLE 
documentation for additional information on the available options. STSPLUS 
generates ECI X-Y-Z state vectors for the true equator and equinox of date 
and may use any of three units of measure. NASA, on the other hand, usually 
generates their state vectors for the mean equinox and equator of 1950 
("M50") and uses feet and feet/second units of measure. Obviously, using 
the wrong units of measure or coordinate system will yield invalid results!
     VEC2TLE has been extensively validated and tested in conjunction with 
STSPLUS using NASA ECI state vectors (provided courtesy Willie Musty, 
Mission Support, Rockwell International, Downey, CA) beginning with Space 
Shuttle missions STS-56 and STS-55 in early 1993. The resulting 2-line 
elements yielded orbiter positions which corresponded exactly with those 
shown live on NASA Select TV, and the 2-line elements were in close 
agreement with 2-line elements subsequently released by US Space Command 
for a comparable epoch. In fact, during mission STS-56, Rockwell used 2-
line elements at their Mission Control Center which I generated using 
VEC2TLE when USSPACECOM and NASA 2-line elements were not forthcoming in a 
timely manner.
     In addition to simply converting state vectors to 2-line elements, 
the primary purpose of the program, VEC2TLE may be used in conjunction with 
STSPLUS or other sources of state vectors to model orbit adjust burns and 
similar maneuvers. STSPLUS is used to generate a state vector at the 
midpoint of the burn, the appropriate delta velocities (obtained 
independently) are added to the state vector quantities Xdot, Ydot, and 
Zdot, then new, post-burn 2-line elements are generated with VEC2TLE. More 
complex maneuvers may also be calculated or modeled although these more 
complicated exercises are not recommended for the novice. VEC2TLE may also 
be used to precess a set of 2-line elements to the next Ascending Node, 
required by some software.
     My thanks to Ken Ernandes for writing VEC2TLE, for making it available 
to the satellite tracking community, and for his assistance in validating 
the precision state vector output data from STSPLUS. Thanks also to Willie 
Musty (for providing state vectors) and to Joel Runes (for validation and 
testing). As with any complex program, considerable effort has been 
expended in writing, testing, and documenting the program. If you use ŠVEC2TLE, please register your copy so as to encourage Ken and others to 
continue writing such useful software.

PROGRAM OPERATION
-----------------

     STSPLUS automatically checks for the presence of a VGA or EGA and will 
execute in color if one is found UNLESS the /M command line option is used 
to force monochrome operation. However, if you wish to operate STSPLUS in 
the EGA mode when you have a VGA monitor, you must use the /EGA option. In 
cases where a monochrome monitor is connected to an adapter which simulates 
color with gray scale, the /M command line option may be omitted but the 
various portions of the display may or may not be visible. The EGA mode is 
generally not correctly emulated with VGA LCD displays and the display may 
appear compressed vertically or have multiple scan lines repeated.
     STSPLUS depends upon the Microsoft VBDOS BASIC Compiler to determine 
whether or not a particular monitor type is available. Some video adapter 
boards which claim to be VGA are not recognized as such by BASIC and 
therefore cannot be used in the higher resolution VGA display mode. 
Similarly, "clone" Hercules Graphics Cards do not always perform correctly.
     The /M option is not required for HGC and CGA graphics operation, 
since those adapters always render their "high resolution" graphics in 
monochrome. Although color CGA systems do have a 3-color mode, the limited 
number of colors and coarse resolution of 320x200 is not suitable for 
STSPLUS. Naturally, the appearance of the program is enhanced by the use of 
color. The vertical resolution is also adjusted depending upon the type of 
adapter which has been detected. Microsoft does not support SVGA adapter 
cards in their VBDOS BASIC Compiler, unfortunately. Once STSPLUS has 
started, the display type may not be changed without exiting the program at 
the Main Menu with the ESC key, then restarting the program with the 
desired command line options.
     The program checks for the presence of a math coprocessor and will use 
it if found. Since the calculations required to determine orbital data are 
very complex, the use of a math coprocessor will improve the speed of 
operation by a very substantial amount. Users without a math coprocessor 
are warned at program startup that performance may be reduced.


     SATELLITE ICON SELECTIONS
     -------------------------

     STSPLUS selects an internal icon or symbol used to graphically 
represent the satellite based upon the satellite name or NORAD Number. 
Three internal icons are available in two sizes each: for satellite names 
which start with the letters "STS" STSPLUS will use an icon resembling a 
plan view of the Space Shuttle; for the Mir Space Station (NORAD Number 
#16609) STSPLUS will use a special icon resembling that space station; and, 
for all other missions STSPLUS will use an icon resembling the Hubble Space 
Telescope. The standard internal icons are 15x15 pixels and are suitable 
for most applications. Including the "/21" command line option will select 
alternate 21x21 pixel icons which may be more appropriate for television 
and projection display formats. STSPLUS also checks for a file with the 
name "#nnnnn.ICN", where "nnnnn" is a 5-digit NORAD Number, and if present 
uses that icon file for the specified satellite; for example, the icon file 
"#16609.ICN" will be used in place of the internal icons for the Mir Space ŠStation. Icon files may be created and modified using the program STSICON, 
available with program registration only. External icons up to 25x25 pixels 
may be created by program STSICON.

     MAP DATABASE FILE SELECTIONS
     ----------------------------

     STSPLUS reads the map coordinates from the appropriate map database 
files. Map database files are selected automatically according to the ZOOM 
or MAG factor currently in use. Lowest detail maps (world or hemisphere 
views) ALWAYS use EARTH4 map database files; higher detail maps will select 
higher detail map database files (EARTH3 through EARTH1) automatically if 
present. The EARTH3 Map Database Files are included with program 
registration; EARTH2 and EARTH1 Map Database Files are available by mail 
only for an additional donation. For most applications, the EARTH4 and 
EARTH3 Map Database Files will be sufficient.
     The map coordinates are automatically converted to screen coordinates 
for the type of monitor detected or specified by command line option, the 
current projection method (rectangular or orthographic), and the current 
magnification or zoom factor. The use of high magnification maps with slow 
computers may result in constant redrawing of screen maps for fast moving 
low Earth orbit satellites.

     Once the initial "housekeeping" chores have been performed, the Title 
Screen is displayed for 15 seconds for normal program operation or for 3 
seconds if the "/R" command line option has been used. The Main Menu, 
described in a subsequent section, is then displayed. Press ENTER to 
proceed to the Main Menu immediately.Š     The Title Screen displays the program version, current time and date, 
last mission, and 2-line elements path and filename. It also displays the 
type of Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Numeric Data Processor (NDP, or

80286, 80386, and 80486 processors and the associated math coprocessor; if 
the math coprocessor is not present or fails a simple test, it will show as 
"(not installed)". The program detects CGA, HGC, EGA and VGA display 
systems; unless the "/M" command line option is used to force monochrome 
operation, EGA and VGA systems will always indicate "Color".

STSORBIT PLUS SATELLITE TRACKING FEATURES
-----------------------------------------

     The principal objective of STSPLUS is to graphically display the 
position of the space shuttle or satellite relative to a map of the world 
or some relevant portion of the world along with relevant time and 
numerical data. Two map projections and six different map displays are 
available: Orthographic, World, Quadrant, Zoom, Location, Tracking Station, 
and Satellite Motion. Varying magnifications or zoom factors are available 
in most map modes. Each is discussed below.
     In addition to the map itself, a number of other items of interest are 
displayed. Some features are available only with higher resolution displays 
(EGA and VGA) in order to avoid cluttering the display screen. Other 
features may be enabled or disabled according to the user's preference. The 
sections which follow the map types discuss these various features.
     Before displaying a ground track display, STSPLUS performs a series of 
calculations to determine the orbit including perigee (the lowest point in 
the orbit relative to a spherical Earth). If the perigee is less than 75 
nautical miles (or about 138 kilometers), it is likely that the satellite 
may have already decayed or soon will do so. STSPLUS then displays a 
warning message:

     Satellite JIANBING-93 P/L (#22870) indicates a perigee
     less than 75 nautical miles and may have decayed.

          Perigee at Epoch:     67.94 nm     125.82 km
          Apogee at Epoch:     118.81 nm     220.04 km

     STSPLUS may be unable to determine a valid orbit!

     Use Function Key F2 from the Main Menu to select another
     satellite and verify the satellite NAME and NORAD NUMBER.

     Press ENTER to return to the Main Menu OR
     press ESC to attempt orbit calculations ...

Press ENTER to return to the Main Menu and use F2 to select another 
satellite or press ESC to force STSPLUS to attempt the orbital calculations 
regardless of whether or not the satellite may have decayed. If the 
satellite is still in what STSPLUS calculates is a possible orbit, the 
ground track display will be displayed as usual. However, if the orbit has 
already decayed, STSPLUS may display a BASIC Error and abort to DOS; if 
this occurs, restart STSPLUS and select a different satellite using F2 from 
the Main Menu.


Orthographic Projection Maps
----------------------------

     The orthographic projection views the Earth as a sphere as if from a 
great distance (perspective is not included) and is the latest addition to 
the map projections available in STSPLUS. This projection has the advantage Šthat the map may be centered at any point on the Earth and may include a 
pole, especially helpful for high inclination satellite orbits. Unlike the 
world map shown with rectangular projection, only one hemisphere can be 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 53


seen at a given time and therefore automatic map redrawing is always 
enabled. Because of the more complex calculations required to generate a 
map, users with slower computers may find that drawing times in the 
orthographic modes are unacceptably long. (A math coprocessor will improve 
map drawing times by almost a factor of ten!)
     Orbital ground tracks, especially for high inclination orbits, and the 
solar terminator are more readily understood using this projection. The 
orthographic projection displays circles of visibility as true circles near 
the center of the map. 
     The default magnification for orthographic maps is 100% which displays 
the entire globe as a hemisphere. Using the PgUp and PgDn keys, the 
magnification may be selected from 100% to 4000% (2000% if Level 1 maps are 
not present). Each time the map is drawn, the center of the map is selected 
so that the satellite will remain on the map for the longest time 
practical. When high magnification factors are selected and the computer is 
not equipped with a math coprocessor, it is possible that the map drawing 
time will exceed the time the satellite is in view; this will cause the map 
to be immediately redrawn. The current map database file and map drawing 
time are shown near the bottom of the data block (e.g. "EARTH4   10.91").
     Because only one hemisphere is shown (or a portion of a hemisphere 
when magnification factors greater than 100% are used), automatic map 
generation is ALWAYS enabled in orthographic modes. In addition, even if 
the satellite never leaves the current map (as is the case with 
geosynchronous satellites), the map will be redrawn every 2.5 hours. Users 
without a math coprocessor may find that map drawing times in orthographic 
modes are painfully slow. The only remedy is to purchase a new, more 
powerful computer or to add a math coprocessor chip; this will improve 
performance by about a factor of ten and the math coprocessor chips are now 
relatively inexpensive, often under $100.
     The orthographic version of the Satellite Motion Map, enabled with the 
"M" key when the map is displayed on the screen (EGA and VGA systems ONLY) 
centers the satellite on the map and "moves" the map beneath the satellite 
using EGA graphics. The next map is started in offscreen memory as soon as 
a map is completed and displayed, then that map is displayed when completed 
and the process is repeated. Especially for slower computers, this map mode 
may be preferred since a map is always on the screen (once the first map is 
drawn) regardless of the drawing time required.
     As a footnote, the orthographic version of the Satellite Motion Map 
can duplicate many of the views presented on NASA Select TV during a 
mission. NASA frequently uses the equivalent of MAG=150 or MAG=200 for 
their display. STSPLUS, however, can display far greater map detail than 
can the NASA program, especially when the Level 3 and Level 2 map database 
files are present.


Rectangular Projection World Maps
---------------------------------

     The STSPLUS rectangular projection (similar to Mercator projection) 
ground track display defaults to a map of the world centered on the Prime 
Meridian (0 degrees) and extending from approximately +85 degrees North 
latitude to -85 degrees South latitude using a linear cylindrical Šprojection. Omitting the two 5 degree bands at the poles permits better 
detail in the mid latitudes where all space shuttle orbits and many other 
satellite orbits are concentrated and avoids the extreme distortion 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 54


inherent in the rectangular projection near the poles. Ground track details 
very near the poles are therefore sacrificed for a better display in the 
main portion of typical orbits. The vertical resolution of the display is 
automatically adjusted for the type of display system in use from 200 lines 
(CGA) to 480 lines (VGA). Two World Maps are available: one centered on the 
Prime Meridian at Greenwich, England (0 degrees longitude); and, one 
centered on the International Date Line (180 degrees longitude).
     All screen maps drawn by STSPLUS use a vector database derived from 
the Micro World Database II. The full map of the world as used here 
can include up to approximately 470,000 sets of vector coordinates 
describing the world's coastlines, islands, lakes, and major rivers when 
used with the highest detail (Level 1) map database.
     Pressing the "W" or "0" key will switch the display to the World map. 
If automatic map generation is enabled, STSPLUS will select the map which 
most nearly centers the satellite on the map. If automatic map generation 
is disabled, pressing "W" or "0" will toggle between the two maps. When 
automatic map generation is enabled, the letter "A" appears in the upper 
right of the screen.


Rectangular Projection Quadrant Maps
------------------------------------

     The original STSORBIT program used a digitized pixel map of the world 
derived from an EGA display. As a consequence of the EGA source, boundaries 
were sometimes discontinuous on VGA displays and the display on a CGA was 
sometimes difficult to read. STSPLUS uses a vector map drawing method which 
automatically adjusts to the display type and the scale of the map. The full 
world map (above) is quite similar in appearance to the original display.
     However, some geographic details are still difficult to distinguish, 
even on a VGA display. STSPLUS includes twelve quadrant maps, each covering 
1/4 of the Earth's surface and using rectangular projection. These are 
numbered 1 to 12 and are centered on the world map roughly according to the 
following illustrations:
                   0                                180             
     +---------------------------+     +---------------------------+

     +---------------------------+     +---------------------------+


The center vertical quadrants in the left illustration, 4 through 6, are 
centered on the Prime Meridian at zero degrees longitude (Greenwich, ŠEngland). The center vertical quadrants in the right illustration, 10 
through 12, are centered on the International Date Line at 180/-180 
degrees. The center horizontal quadrants, 2, 5, 8, and 11, are centered on 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 55


the Equator.
     Each individual quadrant map may be selected by pressing the 
corresponding number key, "1" through "9"; use keys "!", "@", and "#" to 
select quadrants 10, 11, and 12 respectively. Pressing any of these keys 
for individual quadrant maps will disable automatic map generation if it is 
enabled (indicated by the letter "A" at the upper right of the screen). 
Pressing "Q" will allow STSPLUS to select the quadrant most appropriate for 
the satellite's current position.


Rectangular Projection Zoom Maps
--------------------------------

     Although I was pleased with the enhanced maps using the Quadrant Mode, 
the map data base files contain far more information than can be 
effectively displayed in that mode. The next obvious step was to add the 
ZOOM feature, maps which yielded greater detail and which spanned as little 
as 30 degrees across the screen, six times better than the 180 degree 
quadrant maps. This approaches the practical limit for the map database 
files. Because of the smaller area covered, a different approach was used 
for map selection. There would simply be too many different possibilities 
for manual selection so a fully automatic Zoom Mode was implemented which 
calculates the optimum map center point based upon the current position of 
the satellite.
     Press the "Z" key to enable Zoom Mode. The initial map width is 75 
degrees; use PgUp to widen the map width (up to 180 degrees) or PgDn to 
narrow the map width (down to 30 degrees. The Home key will always select 
75 degrees width and the End key will return to the prior field of view. 
The width of the map is shown at the upper right of the map display. Press 
the TAB key to enable or disable automatic map generation (the map will 
always be redrawn). When automatic map generation is enabled, the letter 
"A" appears in the upper right corner of the screen next to the map width 
or field of view. Zoom field of view selections are 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 
120, and 180 degrees.


Location Maps with Isocontours
------------------------------

     By popular request, especially from the amateur radio community, I 
have added the Location Map with Isocontours. (Isocontours is a term coined 
by Rob Matson for his SkyMap program and for which he generously supplied 
sample code which I adapted for STSPLUS.) Press the "L" key when the map 
display is present to select this display. The map will be drawn with the 
current magnification/zoom factor and centered on the user's location. The 
usual circle of visibility will be drawn and within that "circle" are seven 
isocontours representing viewing angles of 10 through 70 degrees in ten 
degree increments (five degree increments at maximum magnification 
factors). The projection, orthographic or rectangular, used for the 
Location Map is the projection in use when the "L" key is pressed. The 
balance of the Location Map includes the usual features.
     If you have entered a second location (using F10+F2 from the Main ŠMenu), pressing the "L" key when the Location Map is already displayed will 
toggle between your primary location and the second location. The data 
related to your location (Location, Altitude, Azimuth, etc.) is calculated 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 56


with respect to the indicated location. If no second location has been 
entered, pressing the "L" key while the Location Map is displayed will have 
no effect. Since this map mode uses the ZOOM map algorithms, the usual zoom 
map features (PgUp, PgDn, Home, End) are active.
     The principal advantage of the Location Map is, of course, the 
isocontours -- lines of equal viewing altitude (line of sight not taking 
into account any refraction near the horizon) from the user's own location. 
The user can immediately tell by inspection whether current or upcoming 
passes will be "good" and what approximate maximum satellite viewing 
altitude can be expected. Amateur radio buffs who need to know if a pass 
will appear above some altitude threshold, say 20 degrees, now have that 
information available visually.


Location Maps with Specified Map Center
---------------------------------------

     NOTE: This feature is ONLY available with orthographic maps!

     Geography teachers for grades K through 12 have requested a special 
feature which allows STSPLUS to be used in the classroom to study geography 
using STSPLUS' orthographic maps. Enable the Location Map Mode by pressing 
the "O" (letter OH) for orthographic maps followed by the "L" to enable 
Location Maps. Pressing the slash key ("/") while the orthographic Location 
Map is displayed, a special screen is displayed which allows the user to 
enter specific latitude and longitude coordinates for the center of the 
orthographic map:

          Enter coordinates (in degrees) of desired map center:

          Enter Map Center Latitude:
          Enter Map Center Longitude:

As prompted, enter the desired map center latitude and longitude in degrees 
(and optionally fractional degrees) followed in each case by ENTER. The 
orthographic map will be immediately drawn. A small RED CROSSHAIR marks the 
center of the map. Since this map mode uses the ZOOM map algorithms, the 
usual zoom map features (PgUp, PgDn, Home, End) are active. This special 
map mode also allows the use of the UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys to 
move the map center by the amount indicated for grid spacing for the 
current map display. The arrow keys may therefore be used to "move around" 
once an area of interest has been specified.
     As a simple example of this feature, enter -17.5 degrees latitude and 
-150 degrees longitude to display the map centered near Papeete, Tahiti. 
Any location on the globe may be displayed. Entering a latitude of 90 
degrees will display the North Pole and pressing the LEFT or RIGHT arrow 
keys will cause the globe to rotate.
     Note that use of this feature at higher zoom factors will be enhanced 
with the higher level Map Database Files (EARTH3, EARTH2 and EARTH1). The 
EARTH3 Map Data Base Files are available for download from my FTP site. 
EARTH2 and EARTH1 Map Database Files are only available with registration 
of STSPLUS; see the file README for registration information.ŠProgram STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 57


Tracking Station Maps with Isocontours
--------------------------------------

     The Tracking Station Maps with Isocontours are similar to the Location 
Maps except that they use the current TRACKING STATION file locations 
rather than the user's location(s). This feature was implemented at the 
request of folks working on the STS-49 Intelsat Reboost Mission. STSPLUS 
was used operationally by INTELSAT during this mission at their Launch 
Control Center near Washington, DC, and at their five ground tracking 
stations around the world. I subsequently received a letter thanking me for 
the use of the program and saying that it was "critical to mission 
success".
     Pressing the "T" key will select this map mode. STSPLUS calculates 
which of the available tracking stations is nearest to the current 
satellite position and centers that tracking station on the screen. This is 
calculated by determining the angular difference between the sub-satellite 
point and each tracking station. However, this means that depending upon 
the Zoom factor in effect, the satellite may or may not be visible on the 
screen. For example, if the sub-satellite point is in South America and the 
only tracking station in the Western Hemisphere is in the United States, 
the satellite cannot be seen at narrower fields of view.
     The "tracking stations" may be any locations the user chooses and 
includes in the current TRACKING STATION file. Several different tracking 
station files accompany the normal STSPLUS distribution as described in the 
section "NASA Ground Tracking Stations" below. Use Function Key F7 from the 
Main Menu to select the desired file. Tracking Station files are identified 
by the filetype ".TRK" and may contain 50 locations maximum; if the current 
Tracking Station file contains more than 50 entries, only the first 50 will 
be used. STSPLUS contains an internal list of NASA tracking stations which 
will be used if the current tracking station file cannot be found. The file

Set Satellite Coordinates
-------------------------

     The F10 command may be used while the tracking map is displayed to 
select the units used to display the current coordinates for the satellite. 
The choices are:

     Ra/Dec    Right Ascension (hours) and Declination (degrees), Equator 
               and Equinox of Date.

     Elv/Azm   Elevation and Azimuth. Elevation (altitude) is the elevation 
               in degrees above the horizon (assuming mean sea level), and 
               azimuth is the direction in degrees in the sense NESW (North 
               to East to South to West).

               Pressing F10 a second time provides COMPLEMENTARY (also 
               known as "inverted") Elevation and Azimuth to accomodate 
               amateur radio antenna systems which have a stop at North or 
               South. (See note below). These are labeled (in YELLOW) as 
               "CEl" and "CAz" and are calculated as:

                    CEl = El - 180
                    CAz = (Az + 180) MOD 360

               See the section "Normal and Complementary Azimuth/Elevation 
               Tracking" for additional discussion.

     XYZ       Geocentric Cartesian Coordinates. The X-Axis and Y-Axis are 
               aligned with the Equator with the X-Axis pointing in the 
               direction of the Vernal Equinox. The Z-Axis points toward 
               the North Pole.

     TARGET    Relative Range and Velocity for a Target Satellite selected 
               from among the current Secondary Satellites. Use F6+F5 from 
               the Main Menu to select the Target Satellite BEFORE 
               selecting this mode. When enabled, the data are displayed in 
               metric or English units:

               TARGET:   20580          Target NORAD Number
               Rng:    1661.69 km       Relative Range, kilometers
               Vel:      -1.85 m/s      Relative Velocity, meters/second

               or:

               TARGET:   20580          Target NORAD Number
               Rng:     902.55 nm       Relative Range, nautical miles
               Vel:      -6.4 ft/s      Relative Velocity, feet/second

               or:

               TARGET:   20580          Target NORAD Number
               Rng:    1045.63 sm       Relative Range, nautical milesŠ               Vel:      -4.45 mph      Relative Velocity, statute 
                                        miles/hour

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 59


               NOTES: 

               1.   This mode cannot be enabled if a Target Satellite has 
                    not been selected. Relative Range and Velocity are 
                    displayed ONLY if the Relative Range is less than 
                    10,000 kilometers. Since this is a "line of sight" 
                    calculation, data for large ranges may be misleading 
                    (cutting through the Earth)!

               2.   When evaluating relative range and velocity, users 
                    should note that during rendezvous operations the 
                    orbits of the two satellites may NOT be closely 
                    synchronized and the approaching satellite's orbit will 
                    often have a significant eccentricity. This can make 
                    the range and relative velocity increase and decrease 
                    over a large range of values! Velocity in particular 
                    can have both positive and negative values as the range 
                    increases and decreases during the course of an orbit.

               3.   The complementary (inverted) Elevation and Azimuth 
                    tracking feature has been implemented to accommodate a 
                    hardware limitation in most two-axis antenna drives. 
                    The most popular amateur antenna rotors provide a full 
                    360 degrees of azimuth coverage but have a "stop" point 
                    that does not allow "through" tracking; this "stop" is 
                    usually at North or South. If the stop is encountered 
                    in the middle of a satellite pass, tracking must cease 
                    while the antenna is rotated through 360 degrees, a 
                    process which can take up to one minute and is a 
                    significant portion of a typical 8 to 10 minute Mir or 
                    Space Shuttle pass. The stop situation can be at least 
                    an inconvenience in other longer duration passes.

     For modes involving distances, select the desired units of measure 
using F9 while the map is displayed.


Location and Features Labels
----------------------------

     Beginning with Version 9240, STSPLUS can add labels for locations and 
features to all maps. Enable or disable location and features labels using 
Function Keys F10+F3+F9 from the Main Menu. By default, STSPLUS expects the 
geographic location and features data to be in file STSPLUS.LOC. If you 
have created your own .LOC file or the file is not in the current 
directory, use F7 from the Main Menu to specify an alternate file and/or 
path. The supplied file includes 350+ locations (cities) and features 
(oceans and seas), their coordinates, and certain information required by 
the program. The file is standard ASCII "comma-delimited" data with place 
names delimited by double quotation marks. The following is a typical data 
line in the file:
Š     "London",-.1167,51.5,7,100
      ---+--  ---+-- --+- + -+-
         |       |     |  |  |
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 60


         |       |     |  |  +---  Minimum magnification to display
         |       |     |  |
         |       |     |  +------  Color to display label (1 to 15)
         |       |     |
         |       |     +---------  Latitude in degrees
         |       |
         |       +---------------  Longitude in degrees
         |
         +-----------------------  Location or feature name

The label will be displayed if the current magnification is equal to or 
greater than the minimum magnification value specified for that label. All 
label names are converted to upper case for display; avoid the use of 
punctuation other than the period ("."), dash ("-"), or comma (",").
     The minimum magnification factors in file STSPLUS.LOC have been 
carefully selected so that the display is not too "cluttered" at a given 
magnification and so that location or feature names near to each other do 
not usually overlap each other. Some care is required when adding new 
locations to avoid this problem! If you wish to add your own locations 
and/or features, use the supplied STSPLUS.LOC file as a guide and template 
for your changes. Use a standard ASCII editor; word processor users must 
use the "non-document" mode.
     Magnifications are calculated automatically and range from 50% to 
4000%, depending upon the map mode in effect. In orthographic map mode the 
magnification factor is displayed as "MAG". In rectangular map modes, the 
displayed ZOOM factor is the approximate field of view and may be converted 
to magnification according to the following table:

    ZOOM    MAG
    -----------
     360     50    World maps
     180    100    Quadrant and Zoom maps
     120    150    )
      90    200    )
      75    240    ) Zoom maps
      60    300    )
      45    400    )
      30    600    )

The "color" is a number from 1 to 15 according to the following table:

     Black   = 0       Gray      = 8
     Blue    = 1       LtBlue    = 9
     Green   = 2       LtGreen   = 10
     Cyan    = 3       LtCyan    = 11
     Red     = 4       LtRed     = 12
     Magenta = 5       LtMagenta = 13
     Brown   = 6       Yellow    = 14
     White   = 7       LtWhite   = 15

The color Black is ignored and is only shown for completeness. If the color 
is a NEGATIVE number, the small circle marking the location of the city or Šfeature will NOT be displayed and the label will be displayed centered on 
the coordinates specified. Thus, if a mountain range, lake, or river is to 
be labeled, you may wish to set the color negative.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 61


     The latitude and longitude are expressed in degrees and decimal 
fractions of a degree; West longitudes and South latitudes must be 
negative. Note that many atlases show a number such as "24.45" which is 
actually 24 degrees and 45 minutes (NOT 24.45 degrees!) and should be 
entered as "24.75" (24 + 45/60). When using multi-line feature labels (see 
file STSPLUS.LOC for examples), labels should be spaced approximately one 
degree apart in latitude for display at a magnification of 100%, less for 
higher magnifications. All labels are automatically centered with respect 
to longitude.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The program performs no error checking on the contents of 
the location and features file. Avoid the use of punctuation other than the 
period or comma. Be sure to use a simple ASCII editor or use your word 
processor in the "Non-Document" mode when editing or creating a location 
and features file. Illegal characters will be replaced by a SPACE. Very 
strange results can appear if the wrong data are present or the wrong 
number of items is in a data line!


Big Clock Options
-----------------

     In rectangular map projections, STSPLUS defaults to a standard display 
with a text block shown on the lower five lines of the display; three 
different times are shown at the lower left of this display: Launch/Epoch 
date and time, UTC date and time, and local date and time. Pressing 
Function Key F2 while the map is displayed switches between this default 
mode and three Big Clock modes: UTC date and time, local date and time, and 
MET/T+Epoch. Because of display space limitations, big clock options are 
NOT available in orthographic projections.
     For EGA and VGA users, an additional command line option, "/CLK", is 
available which changes the number of lines per screen to 43 and 60 lines 
respectively for rectangular projections. The big clocks are then placed 
below the standard data instead of replacing a portion of the regular data 
area.
     In orthographic modes, VGA monitors ONLY, F2 will display the time at 
the bottom of the data block at the right of the screen. Note that for all 
magnification factors above 100%, the time is shortened to hours and 
minutes because of display space limitations.


Satellite Motion Maps
---------------------

     It is sometimes instructive and interesting to see the ground track 
from the satellite point of view. The Satellite Motion Map, available 
ONLY with EGA and VGA displays, centers the satellite in the display and 
draws the map accordingly. Unlike all other map displays, this mode takes 
advantage of the dual-page capability of the EGA display and the VGA 
display (operating in EGA emulation mode); the current map is always 
displayed and the new map is drawn "off screen" and updated as frequently 
as the capability of the processor will permit. For VGA users, the vertical Šmap resolution in this mode is reduced from 400 lines to 280 lines 
(rectangular projections) and from 480 lines to 350 lines (orthographic 
projection).
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 62


     Users with slow computers may prefer this display because, once the 
map has been drawn the first time (however long that may take), a complete 
map is always displayed. This is especially true at higher zoom or 
magnification factors where the map is redrawn more frequently.
     The Satellite Motion Map is enabled by pressing the "M" key when the 
map is displayed. The Motion Map will be displayed using the same 
projection as is presently in effect, rectangular (automatically switches 
to zoom) or orthographic. When switching to this map mode, the message 

          Switching to EGA Dual-Page Mode ...

is displayed on the screen while the initial map is being drawn offscreen. 
Thereafter, the map is drawn off-screen and will require the "usual" time 
during which the screen will be unchanged. (My 386DX systems update every 
10 seconds but my 286 systems can only manage every 20 or 30 seconds -- and 
they all have math coprocessors!) The following keys are active when the 
Satellite Motion Map is displayed:

          Home      Zoom=75 (rect) or Mag=100 (ortho)
          End       Return to last zoom/mag
          PgDn      Decrease field of view (zoom in)
          PgUp      Increase field of view (zoom out)
          M         Return to normal map mode (rect or ortho)
          ENTER     Return to Main Menu


Satellite Position and Orbit Projections
----------------------------------------

     The focus of the display, and the reason for program STSPLUS, is to 
show the position of the spacecraft or satellite. For the space shuttle 
(and provided the mission name begins with the letters "STS"), an icon has 
been chosen which resembles that spacecraft. Likewise with the Mir Space 
Station, a special internal icon is used. For all other satellites, an icon 
has been chosen which resembles the Hubble Space Telescope. See the section 
Satellite Icon Selections for additional information. In either case, the 
symbol is shown in the following colors (EGA and VGA displays only):

          Satellite is sunlit                Bright White
          Satellite is in penumbra           Yellow
          Satellite in refracted sunlight    Red
          Satellite is in umbra              Dim White

In addition, special characters ("*", "+" or "-") are shown to the right of 
"Orbit #" when the satellite is sunlit or in penumbra; this will assist 
users of monochrome monitors where colors cannot be distinguished. For 
better visibility, the satellite symbol will normally "blink" on CGA 
monitors; the symbol may be made to blink on any system if desired by 
pressing the letter "B" while the ground track is displayed. Note however 
that for very slow computers, the blink may appear erratic if most of the 
time is spent performing calculations.
     Just seeing the spacecraft or satellite on the map display yields Šinformation as to its present position. However, for satellite viewing and 
planning purposes, STSPLUS calculates the predicted ground track for 
approximately three hours in the future and the past ground track for 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 63


approximately one and a half hours in the past. The ground track may be 
selected to display as a series of light green dots (future track) or light 
red dots (past track), as a solid light green line, or as a solid light 
green line with yellow dots(future track) and light red dots (past track). 
The dots are plotted at one minute intervals. To select the desired ground 
track display, press Function Key F10 and then press Function Key F5 until 
the desired mode is displayed; the available selections are: OFF, DOTS, 
LINE, and BOTH.
     Note that for satellites in high Earth orbits, the ground track may 
appear as a solid line if the dots are very close together. Unlike prior 
versions of STSPLUS, the ground track is NOT updated (except to re-color 
dots for past track). With automatic map generation off, the map will be 
automatically redrawn every 2.5 hours.


Satellite Visibility
--------------------

     Satellite visibility, or the ability to see a satellite with the naked 
eye (or binoculars for the truly dedicated), attracts the novice and expert 
alike. It can be a great thrill to point out the Space Shuttle or MIR Space 
Station to a child or a friend as it streaks across the sky where and when 
predicted. Unfortunately, predicting that visibility is more complicated 
than "simple" orbital mechanics and trigonometry; spacecraft altitude, 
position, physical geometry, reflectivity, and attitude with respect to 
both the viewer and the Sun, as well as local atmospheric clarity not to 
mention weather, all contribute to whether or not a satellite may actually 
be seen. Some of these factors are beyond the capabilities of a program 
like STSPLUS. All that can be done is to indicate when conditions are such 
that the satellite MIGHT be sighted visually. STSPLUS estimates viewer 
visibility by calculating that: 

     a)   The satellite is at least partially lighted by the Sun; 

     b)   The Sun is 1.7 degrees or more below the viewer's horizon so that 
          the viewer is in at least partial darkness; and, 

     c)   The satellite is within the viewer's local circle of visibility 
          and is four degrees or more above the horizon.

If all these conditions are met, STSPLUS displays the word "VIS" in the 
data block next to the orbit inclination. To these calculations must be 
added the uncertainties described above. In my experience, the best 
satellite sightings have usually occurred when I am between the satellite 
and the Sun, enabling flat surfaces such as solar panels to reflect the 
sunlight back to me.
     Although STSPLUS makes the visibility calculations for any satellite, 
as a general rule only satellites in low Earth orbit, say under 1000 km 
(600 miles) altitude, are likely to be seen with the naked eye. Binoculars 
can extend that range somewhat. Satellites in very high or geosynchronous 
orbits can be seen only with precision optical or radar equipment. Last but 
not least, current 2-line elements must be used for reliable predictions.Š

User's Circle of Visibility
---------------------------

     Centered around the user's geographic location, and marked with a 
small circle, is a magenta circle of the approximate line of sight 
visibility for the mission in progress. For rectangular projections, the 
"circle" appears on the display as a circle near the Equator and as a 
distorted circle at higher latitudes. In near-polar regions, the circle 
takes on a very strange shape. The shape is entirely an artifact of the map 
projection; when displayed using the orthographic projection, it appear as 
a true circle near the center of the map. The radius of this circle of 
visibility is calculated for each satellite based upon its altitude at the 
instant the map is first drawn as well as the user's elevation above mean 
sea level and corresponds to "line of sight" visibility for that satellite. 
When a second location has been selected using F10+F2, a second circle of 
visibility will also be drawn for that location.
     When audible alarms are enabled (F10+F8 from the Main Menu), tones 
sound 2 minutes before the satellite enters the circle of visibility and 
again 30 seconds before the satellite leaves the circle of visibility. Both 
the primary and secondary locations are monitored, with slightly different 
tones for each. An "up-down" sequence of tones is used prior to entry into 
the circles and a series of tones prior to leaving the circles.
     When a satellite is within the circle, direct visual, radio or radar 
communications with the satellite should be practical. Actual visibility, 
of course, depends upon more than simply whether or not the satellite is 
above the viewer's horizon. Most important is the sun to satellite to 
viewer geometry; the satellite must be in sunlight and the viewer in 
darkness for reasonable visibility. Almost as important is the size and 
geometry of the satellite itself; a large, bright-metal satellite with huge 
solar arrays reflects far more sunlight than a small dark satellite. In 
addition to the satellites themselves, many booster rockets and other 
"spare parts" are orbiting the Earth. Since they are not attitude 
stabilized, booster rockets often are tumbling and may therefore appear 
to flash on and off as they pass over.
     For the Space Shuttle as well as most other satellites with near 
circular orbits, the circle of visibility calculations are reasonably 
accurate; however, the position of the sun and the effect of atmospheric 
refraction are not taken into account, only whether or not the satellite is 
in line of sight view from the observing location. For highly elliptical 
orbits, however, the accuracy is substantially degraded since the radius of 
the circle of visibility changes dramatically depending upon whether the 
satellite is nearer apogee or perigee at the time the calculation is made, 
and the period of the orbit. In the course of a single orbit, the altitude 
of such a satellite may change by thousands of miles. Satellite "DE 1", 
usually included in the TLEnnn.TXT 2-line elements file, is in a highly 
elliptical orbit with long period and illustrates the problem.Š

Spacecraft Circle of Visibility
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 65


-------------------------------

     The spacecraft circle of visibility is calculated dynamically using 
the same algorithm as for the user's circle of visibility. Like the user's 
circle, the spacecraft circle may appear on rectangular projections as an 
odd shape because of the scaling factors used by the map projection. The 
difference is that the spacecraft circle moves with the spacecraft and 
illustrates the approximate area visible from the spacecraft at any given 
moment. The circle is updated every ten seconds (or as frequently as the 
processor will permit). Comparisons using a VGA display system during the 
STS-35/ASTRO-1 mission in December, 1990 confirmed that the circle shown is 
quite close to that shown by one of the special graphics displays 
occasionally seen on NASA Select Television as well as the actual horizon 
view seen from the payload bay television cameras.


SUN and Solar Features
----------------------

     Many types of observations, especially Earth observations, often 
require that the target or terrain be in sunlight. The performance of solar 
panels and certain other instruments on a spacecraft is dependent upon 
whether or not the Sun is in view. Also, it is usually impossible to 
visually see a spacecraft which is not in sunlight. The solar terminator is 
a series of yellow points on the display which represent the line at which 
the center of the Sun is at an observer's horizon for Mean Sea Level. 
Although a quick glance at the clock should suffice to determine which side 
of the terminator line is in sunlight and which in darkness, EGA and VGA 
systems also display the Sun as a small yellow circle. 
     The terminator as displayed by STSPLUS is sometimes confused with a 
line denoting sunrise and sunset. Two factors make the terminator only an 
approximation: first, the terminator is based upon the center of the Sun, 
while actual sunrise and sunset are calculated using the upper limb of the 
Sun; and second, the terminator is calculated for Mean Sea Level rather 
than a specific local elevation. These two factors combined can result in a 
difference of up to ten minutes when the times are compared against 
published values or those calculated by my program ASTROCLK, sunrise being 
earlier and sunset being later.
     The Sun and solar features are enabled and disabled using F10+F3+F8 
from the Main Menu. Since these features -- especially the terminator -- 
require some calculation and drawing time, users with slower computers may 
wish to disable these features for faster screen updates. The following 
features are included:

Sun:           A filled yellow circle is plotted at the sub-solar point, 
               the geographic coordinates directly beneath the current 
               position of the Sun. The position of the Sun is recalculated 
               every 10 seconds and the display is updated every 60 
               seconds. (Not shown on CGA and HGC displays.)

Terminator:    A dotted yellow line is plotted for the solar terminator, 
               that point on the Earth at which the center of the Sun is at Š               the horizon. The terminator is partially updated every 10 
               seconds and is fully updated every 60 seconds. The 
               terminator is shown for Mean Sea Level and does NOT take 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 66


               into account the non-spherical shape of the Earth.

Lighting:      The current spacecraft lighting is shown using color for the 
               satellite icon, and in the data block (to the right of 
               "Orbit #:") and displayed using the following symbols and 
               colors:

               *    Bright White   Full sunlight
               +    Yellow         Partial sunlight (penumbra)
               -    Light Red      Refracted sunlight
                    White          Full shadow (umbra), no symbol

               Note that Yellow and Light Red will display as Bright White 
               or shades of gray on monochrome monitors.

               Solar lighting conditions are updated every second or as 
               rapidly as the speed of the processor will permit. In order 
               to minimize calculation delays during ground track plotting, 
               the event times for orbital sunrise and sunset are 
               approximated. The dynamic lighting calculations, used to 
               plot the color of the spacecraft icon, are more precise. 
               Typical errors due to the simplified algorithm, are on the 
               order of 10 seconds.

SUN Timer:     When Event Timers are enabled, the orbital sunrise (AOS) and 
               sunset (LOS) times are shown. A blank AOS or LOS timer 
               indicates the event will not occur within the next four 
               hours. An asterisk ("*") to the left of "SUN" indicates 
               sunlight is on the satellite:

                       AOS    LOS
               *SUN  73:20  37:40

               In this example, the satellite is in sunlight. Orbital 
               sunset will occur in 37:40 and the next orbital sunrise will 
               occur in 73:20.

TDRS and Real Time Satellite Features
-------------------------------------

     TDRS and Real Time Satellite features are available only on EGA and 
VGA monitors. These features permit up to thirty two additional satellites 
to be tracked in real time. Satellites to be tracked are designated by the 
user as "static" (geosynchronous or geostationary) and "real time" 
(satellites whose sub-satellite point changes substantially with time). 
Static satellites are only plotted when the map is redrawn; real time 
satellites are updated every second with 386/387 or better computers, every 
ten seconds for older computers, or as often as the processor can complete 
the required calculations. When using X10 or X60, the update occurs at the 
display rate (10 or 60 seconds).
     When TDRS and Real Time Satellite coverage is enabled (F10+F3+F2), all 
active TDRS satellites (Tracking and Data Relay Satellites), used for most 
communications to and from the Space Shuttle, the Hubble Space Telescope, 
and other active spacecraft, are shown as a dot inside a small circle near 
the Equator (provided they have been included in the current TDRS and Real 
Time Satellite configuration). Use F6 from the Main Menu to display and/or 
modify that configuration. See the text section on Function Key F6 for a 
complete description of Static and Real Time satellites.
     As of August, 1993, there are five TDRS satellites in geosynchronous 
orbit. The primary satellites consist of TDRS East ("TDRS 3") at 
approximately 41 degrees West longitude and the TDRS West Cluster 
consisting of two satellites, TDRS West ("TDRS 4") and TDRS Spare ("TDRS 
1") at approximately 174 and 170 degrees West longitude respectively. The 
TDRS Spare satellite has partially failed but is used occasionally as a 
backup; this satellite is also low on propellant and is allowed to drift 
considerably with an inclination of about 7 degrees. "TDRS 2" has also 
partially failed and is currently parked at approximately 62 degrees West 
longitude and is presently dedicated to downlinking data from GRO, the 
Gamma Ray Observatory, whose tape recorders have failed. "TDRS 5" is the 
most recent satellite launched, is fully operational, and is parked at 
about 138 degrees West longitude as an on-orbit spare. Users should check 
the current positions of the TDRS satellites since they are periodically 
moved or reassigned.
     Each TDRS location provides communications coverage for almost half 
of the Earth for low Earth orbits and essentially full time coverage for 
higher orbits. However, since the NASA Ground Terminals are located at 
White Sands, New Mexico, the coverage has been slightly overlapped to 
provide good ground communications at White Sands. This, in turn, means 
that there is a narrow band, known by NASA as the Zone of Exclusion (marked 
"ZOE" on the screen), off the East coast of Africa which is not covered by 
either primary TDRS for low Earth orbits. Two red "circles" on the display 
show the limits of coverage for each primary TDRS satellite. Each circle, 
whose shape may be quite distorted when using rectangular projection, 
encloses an area where the TDRS satellite is out of range of the primary 
satellite being tracked and is centered on the opposite side of the Earth 
from the TDRS satellite's position.
     While the ground track is being calculated, STSPLUS also calculates 
the times for acquisition of signal (AOS) and loss of signal (LOS). When 
TDRS coverage is enabled, these times are displayed for TDRS East and TDRS ŠWest. The method used for the calculation of the TDRS coverage is usually 
accurate to about 10 seconds (assuming accurate 2-line elements for the 
satellite and for the TDRS). However, spacecraft attitude can cause loss of 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 68


TDRS communications at unexpected times. When Event Timers are enabled, 
STSPLUS calculates AOS and LOS for four hours (240 minutes) from the time 
the map is drawn. If a time is beyond that limit (or if the condition does 
not occur), the time is left blank.
     Each time is presented in the form of a countdown clock, minutes and 
seconds, until the next occurrence of the condition:

         *TDRE AOS/LOS  72:42  50:42     (for rectangular projections)
         *TDRW AOS/LOS  45:42  22:42

                          AOS    LOS
                *TDRE:  72:42  50:42     (for orthographic projections)
                *TDRW:  45:42  22:42

An asterisk ("*") is shown to the left of the satellite name if AOS is in 
effect. For rectangular projections, these data are displayed in the lower 
right portion of the map. For EGA and VGA users, however, the data may be 
displayed in the lower section of the data block by pressing F2 while the 
map is displayed until MET/T+E is displayed. For orthographic projections, 
the data are part of the standard data block at the right of the screen.
     The clocks for each TDRS are color coded to indicate the current 
status: GREEN when the satellite is in communication, and RED when the 
satellite is out of range of the TDRS. Two minutes prior to a change in 
status, the appropriate clock color changes to YELLOW. Users with 
monochrome monitors must observe the presence or absence of the asterisk to 
determine the status.
     STSPLUS can sound an audible alarm (three beeps) 30 seconds prior to 
TDRS AOS or LOS. Use F10+F8 to enable or disable the audible alarms.
     Most satellites which utilize the TDRS system for communications are 
in low Earth orbits (generally below 1500 km). However, other satellites 
may also use the TDRS system for regular or backup communications. The 
NAVSTAR Global Positioning Satellites (GPS), with orbital altitudes of 
about 11,000 nautical miles (20,000 kilometers), are an example. For such 
high orbits, the coverage by each TDRS satellite is nearly continuous.
     As noted above, there are currently five TDRS satellites in orbit as 
of mid 1993, TDRS 1 through TDRS 5. (These numbers are those currently used 
by US Space Command in their 2-line elements. NASA sometimes uses different 
numbers corresponding to the original launch letters as shown in the 
following chart. TDRS "B", which should have become "TDRS 2", was lost in 
the Challenger accident.) As of July, 1993, the TDRS assignments are:

      TDRS#  *   NORAD#     Long    Description
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     TDRS 1 (A)   13969    -170W    TDRS West Spare, used occasionally
     TDRS 2 (C)   19548     -62W    Dedicated to Gamma Ray Observatory
     TDRS 3 (D)   19883     -41W    TDRS East (STSPLUS default)
     TDRS 4 (E)   21639    -174W    TDRS West (STSPLUS default)
     TDRS 5 (F)   22314    -138W    On-orbit spare

     * Original NASA letter designation at launch

STSPLUS will use TDRS 3 and TDRS 4 by default and approximate positions as Šof July, 1993 are automatically saved in file STSPLUS.INI. Note that some 
2-line element files (including TLEnnn.TXT) often refer to the TDRS 
satellites using numbers 1 through 5 or letters A through D or E. Use the 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 69


NORAD numbers to be certain that you display the correct satellite.
     TDRS satellites do change position and/or assignment periodically for 
one reason or another. Users who wish the most accurate TDRS positions and 
AOS/LOS data should periodically update the default positions by using the 
automatic update feature with F2 from the Main Menu to read and update the 
2-line elements.


Ground Tracking Stations and .TRK files
---------------------------------------

     NASA maintains a number of ground tracking stations around the world. 
Some of these tracking stations are essential for the ascent or landing 
phases of a space shuttle flight; others are used for in-flight 
communications. File STSPLUS.TRK contains the information for these ground 
tracking stations. Other files with filetype .TRK contain the information 
for other launch and/or tracking stations.
     Each ground tracking station is shown as a small symbol surrounded by 
a brown or light yellow "circle of visibility" which gives the approximate 
area of antenna coverage and shows how small a proportion of each orbit can 
be monitored without the TDRS system. When for some reason the TDRS system 
is down (as has occurred during infrequent computer failures at White 
Sands, New Mexico, the TDRS Ground Station), these ground tracking stations 
become the only means of communication with the Space Shuttle. (Another 
unexpected method was demonstrated during a 1992 space shuttle mission when 
the SAREX, Shuttle Amateur Radio EXperiment, was used during a complete 
loss of normal communications!) Because of budget constraints, many of 
these ground tracking stations may be (or have already been) shut down. 
Some, such as MIL and BDA (see list below) will be retained because they 
are required for the ascent phase of a space shuttle mission. Others, such 
as HAW, CTS and GWM, are operated jointly with, or independently by, the 
U.S. Air Force. NASA is not always consistent as to the abbreviations used 
for these tracking stations; on NASA Select TV, Gwam, Hawaii, and 
Vandenberg are usually shown as GTS, HTS, and VTS respectively.
     When using rectangular map projections, the shape of the antenna range 
"circle of visibility" varies as a function of the latitude and is an 
artifact of the map projection; when projected on a sphere, as is the case 
with orthographic projection, they are true circles. In order to avoid 
cluttering the display with countless meaningless lines, tracking station 
circles of visibility are shown only if that circle has an angular diameter 
of 90 degrees or less. 
     The following table lists the NASA/DOD internal ground tracking 
stations as of mid-1996 which are shown along with their abbreviations and 
approximate map coordinates (longitude, latitude, elevation):

     STSPLUS first checks for the presence of file STSPLUS.TRK for its 
ground tracking station information. This is the default TRACKING STATION 
filename used if no other selection has been made using F7 from the Main 
Menu. If that file is present, its data is used instead of the internal 
data above. The supplied STSPLUS.TRK has the following format:

     The first mission of Endeavour, STS-49, was in May, 1992. This 
dramatic and exciting mission captured the INTELSAT VI (F3) satellite, 
stranded in a useless orbit by its booster rocket failure since January, 
1990, and attached a new booster rocket which placed the satellite in its 
proper orbit. STSPLUS was used operationally during the mission by 
Intelsat, another "first" for the program. Intelsat used its own ground 
tracking stations for communications with INTELSAT VI (F3); the ground 
stations which participated in the mission are listed in file INTELSAT.TRK

     These TRK files are standard ASCII files and may be edited with any 
editor; word processor users be sure to use the ASCII or non-document mode. 
The files use a standard comma-delimited format as shown; positions are 
given in longitude (degrees) and geodetic latitude (degrees). A maximum of 
50 ground stations is permitted. The use of TRK files is not restricted to 
tracking stations, of course. So long as the correct data format is 
observed, any desired location may be included in the tracking station file 
up to the maximum of 25 locations.


Event Timers and Audible Alarms
-------------------------------

     STSPLUS is often operated for long periods of time with minimum 
operator attention or intervention. Users may perform other tasks while the 
satellite display is active and while awaiting some subsequent event of 
interest. Event timers are displayed for the selected events if they will 
occur within approximately four hours of the time that the map is drawn; if 
an event will not occur within that time, the event is blank. Audible Šalarms serve to alert the user to upcoming selected events. The event 
timers are enabled with F10+F7 from the Main Menu. Audible alarms are 
enabled with F10+F8 from the Main Menu and require also that the event 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 72


timers be enabled. All events are termed "AOS" (Acquisition of Signal or 
Source) or "LOS" (Loss of Signal or Source) and are generally calculated 
for line of sight conditions.
     Each phenomena which may be timed has an associated AOS and LOS timer 
which displays the hours and minutes ("HHH:MM") remaining until the next 
event if that event will occur within the next four hours (240 minutes), 
one hour past the last time for which the ground track is plotted. The 
current status of the signal or source is indicated by the color of the 
timer digits and the presence or absence of an asterisk ("*") to the left 
of the event name: GREEN indicates signal or source acquisition, and RED 
indicates signal or source loss. Two minutes prior to an event, the timer 
for that event will change from the signal status color (GREEN or RED) to 
YELLOW to visually alert the user. Users with monochrome monitors will be 
unable to distinguish these color changes, of course, but can determine the 
current signal status using the asterisk indicator.
     All calculations for upcoming events are made each time the ground 
track is drawn on the display and will affect the time required to prepare 
the display, especially on slower computers. In order to minimize these 
calculation delays, the event calculations for orbital sunrise and sunset 
use a simplified algorithm which does not take into account the non-
spherical shape of the earth (unlike the dynamically calculated spacecraft 
lighting features which are more accurate). Orbital sunrise and sunset are 
the times that the spacecraft transitions between refracted sunlight 
(sunlight refracted through the Earth's atmosphere) to partial sunlight 
(illumination from only a portion of the solar disk); this corresponds to 
the transitions between RED and YELLOW color on the satellite icon and 
illumination symbols respectively. The errors resulting from the simplified 
algorithm are usually less than plus or minus 10 seconds; because of the 
more oblique angles and geometry involved, higher errors are usually 
associated with higher inclination orbits.
     The default mode for event timers is countdown clocks in minutes and 
seconds (maximum of about 240 minutes, the time period that the program 
searches forward for events). Function Key F12 may be used to cycle through 
four different event time units: countdown clocks; UTC (GMT) in hours and 
minutes; local time in hours and minutes; and, MET in hours and minutes. If 
no launch time has been set, MET AOS and LOS times will NOT be available. 
The appropriate time units label will be displayed for the last three 
modes; no label is displayed for the countdown clock mode. A blank item 
indicates that the event does not occur within the next four hours.
     When no secondary location is selected, the headings "AOS" and "LOS" 
will appear in orthographic modes; the headings do not appear in 
rectangular modes or in orthographic modes when a secondary location is 
selected in order to make room for the additional line of data. Typical 
Event Timers are shown in the following examples.

For orthographic projections using the countdown clock mode:

          *STN   95:15   6:21           AOS now in effect
                                        AOS will next occur in 95:15
                                        LOS will occur in 6:21

           STN   23:47  45:18           LOS now in effectŠ                                        AOS will occur in 23:47
                                        LOS will next occur in 45:18

and similarly for rectangular projections:

          *TDRW AOS/LOS  85:14  33:43   AOS now in effect
                                        AOS will next occur in 85:14
                                        LOS will occur in 33:43

           TDRW AOS/LOS  14:21  57:32   LOS now in effect
                                        AOS will occur in 14:21
                                        LOS will next occur in 57:32

except the primary location AOS/LOS, which is unlabeled in rectangular 
projections and appears at the upper right of the data block (immediately 
to the right of MET/T+E):

          * 89:39   1:27                AOS now in effect
                                        AOS will next occur in 89:39
                                        LOS will occur in 1:27

            70:15  76:38                LOS now in effect
                                        AOS will occur in 70:15
                                        LOS will next occur in 76:38

Note the use of the asterisk ("*") to mark AOS in the examples above.
     The following events may be timed and will cause an audible alarm if 
audible alarms are enabled and the appropriate events are enabled:

     Local Visibility    For the primary location ("STN" or "STN1"): three 
                         sets of up/down tones two minutes prior to AOS and 
                         five tones thirty seconds prior to LOS. For the 
                         secondary location ("STN2" if enabled): two sets 
                         of up/down tones two minutes prior to AOS and four 
                         tones thirty seconds prior to LOS. Refers to the 
                         times the satellite enters or leaves the local 
                         circle of visibility.

     TDRS Acquisition    ("TDRE" or "TDRW" if enabled) Three short tones 
                         thirty seconds prior to AOS or LOS. Refers to the 
                         times the satellite acquires or loses the ability 
                         to communicate with either of the programmed 
                         Tracking and Data Relay Satellites.

     Orbital Sunrise/set ("SUN" if enabled) Two tones thirty seconds prior 
                         to approximate orbital sunrise or sunset. Refers 
                         to actual line of sight solar contact; refracted 
                         sunlight is not included. 

The characteristics of the audible tones have been selected to allow the 
user to uniquely identify the AOS or LOS event that is about to happen.


Pausing the Ground Track Display
--------------------------------Š
     Pressing F6 will cause the ground track display to "freeze" at the 
current time. This is called PAUSE mode. This permits closer examination of 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 74


the data and/or display at any given time and to "move" the display forward 
and backward in time. Note that the pause takes effect AFTER the next 
second tick on the system clock; thus, if you wish to pause at 01:00 (one 
minute exactly on one of the clocks), press F5 when the display reads 
00:59.
     After pressing F6, the following message will appear near the lower 
right of the screen:

          PAUSE...Press ENTER

This reminds the user that PAUSE is in effect and to press ENTER to 
resume normal operation. When normal operation is resumed, the time 
continues from its present value, as if you had set SIMULATED TIME using 
F8+F3 or F8+F4 from the Main Menu. To return to REAL TIME, use F8+F1 from 
the Main Menu.
     While PAUSE is in effect, the "+" and "-" keys may be used to advance 
or retard the current time by the amount of the current time step. You may 
also use the "=" key instead of the "+" key to avoid pressing the SHIFT 
key. The only other key active in PAUSE mode is F4, which may be used 
to adjust the "time step" by pressing the key until the desired time 
multiplier is displayed at the upper right of the screen. Time multipliers 
of "X1" (no message displayed), "X10", and "X60" are selected in 
succession. The default time step is 1 second.
     Note that the automatic map generation feature is also used in PAUSE 
mode; automatic map generation may be enabled or disabled in the 
rectangular projections (use the TAB key) and is ALWAYS enabled in 
orthographic projections. Thus, when the satellite is moved near the edge 
of the display, the map may be redrawn if the appropriate point is reached.
     If you wish to synchronize the time used by STSPLUS to some other 
source (such as the slightly delayed orthographic displays presented from 
time to time on NASA Select TV), you may also use PAUSE mode for this 
purpose. Simply pause the display, use the "+" or "-" keys to adjust the 
time slightly ahead of the time to which you wish to synchronize. Then 
press ENTER when the times agree. Time can only be synchronized in this 
manner to plus or minus one second. If you need higher precision, set 
SIMULATED TIME using F8+F3 or F8+F4 from the Main Menu.


Switching between MET and T+Epoch
---------------------------------

     STSPLUS by default displays the time elapsed since the epoch date of 
the elements in the upper right portion of the data block unless the launch 
date and time are included in file STSPLUS.LTD, in which case Mission 
Elapsed Time (MET) is the default. This marked on the display as "T+Epoch" 
or "T+E" and "MET" respectively. While T+Epoch is not of particular value 
for satellite viewing purposes, it does indicate the relative age of the 
orbital data. As a general rule, especially for lower Earth orbits, the 
effects of orbit decay make position predictions less accurate as time 
passes. Data which are more than 10 or 20 days old may produce less 
accurate positions.
     For a space shuttle mission, however, all mission events are scheduled Šagainst the mission timeline and are reckoned in Mission Elapsed Time 
(MET), the time elapsed since launch. It is therefore useful to be able to 
display MET during the course of a mission or to review the flight post-
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 75


mission. Unfortunately, the standard NASA/NORAD 2-line element format does 
not include the launch time and launch date and therefore this information 
must be secured independently and manually entered into STSPLUS. Once 
entered, STSPLUS saves the information in file STPLUS.LTD.
     Once the ground track map is displayed, the F5 command may be used to 
switch the display between Time Since Epoch ("T+Epoch" or "T+E") and 
Mission Elapsed Time ("MET").
     The F5 command checks that you have already entered the launch time 
and launch date or that it has been read from file STSPLUS.LTD. If no 
launch time and date are present, the command will have no effect. Press 
ENTER to return to the Main Menu and press F5 to enter launch time and 
launch date.


Using FAST Time
---------------

     Press F4 while the map is displayed to use FAST time. FAST TIME is a 
variation of SIMULATED TIME which automatically advances the time displayed 
by 10 or 60 seconds, as indicated at the upper left of the screen. Press F4 
again to change the time step; when "(X10)" or "(X60)" is NOT displayed, 
the time step is one second. The actual time increment is a function of the 
computer's speed. For fast computers, the time increment will usually be 10 
or 60 seconds but may vary by a second occasionally; for slower computers, 
the time increment may be somewhat longer. FAST time is disabled when PAUSE 
mode is in effect and for the Satellite Motion Map.
     FAST time may be used to advance the display to a future time and for 
demonstration purposes. Once the desired time has been reached, simply 
press F4 until no time step is displayed at the upper left of the screen 
and time will advance normally. Note that FAST time sets the program to 
SIMULATED TIME; to restore "real time", press F8+F1 from the Main Menu. The 
Main Menu also indicates when SIMULATED TIME is in effect: the words 
"Current Time" will appear at the left of the times at the top of the 
screen when real time (the time your DOS clock is using) is in effect; the 
words "Simulated Time" appear when a simulated time is in effect.



On-line Help
------------

     An on-line Help Screen is available during the ground track display 
to remind the user of the more commonly used functions and which keys to 
press to enable those functions. When the ground track display is active, 
press Function Key F1 to display the Help Screen. The following help screen 
will appear in rectangular modes in the lower portion of the screen:

 F1=Resume Data   F6=Pause (+,-)    TAB=Auto Maps On/Off  L=Location Maps
 F2=Select Clocks F7=Circle of Vis    W=World Maps        T=Tracking Maps
 F3=Printer Log                       Q=Quadrant Maps     M=Motion Map
 F4=Time Step     F9=Dist:km/nm/sm    Z=Zoom Maps:        O=Orthographic
 F5=MET/T+Epoch  F10=Coords/Target      Home,PgUp,PgDn    STSPLUS Ver 0123Š
The help screen in orthographic modes is similar but in a vertical format 
at the right side of the screen:
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 76



      F1=Resume Data
      F2=Select Clocks
      F3=Printer Log
      F4=Time Step
      F5=MET/T+Epoch
      F6=Pause (+,-)
      F7=Circle of Vis
      F8=FRQ : AOS/LOS
      F9=Dist:km/nm/sm
     F10=Coords/Target
       W=World Maps
       L=Location Maps
       T=Tracking Maps
       M=Motion Map
     Change Zoom:
      Home,End,PgUp,PgDn
     ENTER = Main Menu

Note that "F8=FRQ : AOS/LOS" (for Doppler shift frequency data) is not 
available in rectangular projections, and the TAB key is not used in the 
orthographic projections. Not shown because of space limitations in the 
orthographic help screen are "Q=Quadrant Maps" and "Z=Zoom Maps". See the 
section ACTIVE KEYS DURING GROUND TRACK DISPLAY for additional information 
on keys which are active and available when the ground track map is active.
     The ground track display will continue to be updated in real time 
while the help screen is displayed. If only the graphical display of the 
ground track is of interest, the help screen may be kept on the display 
continuously. Press Function Key F1 again to return to the normal data 
display. 

NOTE: The Help Screen is DISABLED when the Motion Map is displayed.

Launch Simulation for the Space Shuttle
---------------------------------------

     STSPLUS can generate launch simulation for Space Shuttle launches from 
Cape Canaveral, Florida. Prior to Version 9509, STSPLUS used only 2-Line 
Elements ("TLEs") and assumed that whatever satellite was being displayed 
"had always been in orbit" and that the current position could be 
accurately calculated from the TLEs, not quite in line with the typical 
situation for a Space Shuttle launch! Many STSPLUS viewers were confused by 
the fact that prior to launch, the orbiter appeared to be off the coast of 
Baja California rather than sitting quietly on Pad 39A or 39B at Cape 
Canaveral. The STSPLUS simulation did not catch up with the true orbit 
until approximately the OMS-2 burn (Orbital Maneuvering System, Burn #2) 
which typically occurs about 35 to 45 minutes after launch. The OMS-1 burn 
is not required for a nominal ascent trajectory but its place and number 
are reserved in the STS Timeline regardless of whether or not it takes 
place. I am always relieved by the CapCom call "OMS-1 NOT REQUIRED" because 
that means that the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) and the Main Engines 
(SSMEs) did their job correctly.
     In order for the STSPLUS launch simulation to operate correctly, the 
following data must be available:

          Accurate Estimated Pre-Launch 2-Line Elements (TLEs)

          Planned Launch Time corresponding to the TLEs

In addition, the launch must take place from Cape Canaveral, Florida, not a 
concern since the Vandenberg Space Shuttle launch complex was abandoned 
some years ago. The Launch Simulation must be enabled when entering the 
Launch Time and Date using F5 from the Main Menu (described below).

                          *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

          STSPLUS' Launch Simulation will ONLY execute correctly 
          for Space Shuttle launches from Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
          Attempting to "trick" the program with other spacecraft 
          or invalid TLEs may produce unpredictable results or 
          program crashes!


     Estimated pre-launch TLEs are usually prepared well in advance of a 
flight by Gil Carman or others at the NASA Johnson Space Center, Flight 
Dynamics, in Houston, Texas. These TLEs represent the planned orbit for the 
Space Shuttle for a nominal launch and are calculated for a time (the 
"Epoch" of the TLEs) following the OMS-2 burn. It is the OMS-2 burn which 
circularizes the orbit at the intended altitude; prior to OMS-2, the 
orbiter is in a highly elliptical orbit whose perigee (low point, 
technically the minimum orbital distance from the center of the Earth) is 
some tens of miles above the surface and whose apogee (high point) is at or 
near the planned altitude. The OMS-2 burn occurs at apogee and in effect 
raises the perigee to the planned altitude. With apogee and perigee both at 
approximately the same altitude, a nearly circular orbit is the result. ŠWithout the OMS-2 burn the orbit is not sustainable, dipping too far into 
the Earth's atmosphere, and the orbiter would have to make a landing 
immediately.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 78


     Launch simulation is divided into two phases: Pre-Launch Phase with 
the orbiter on the launch pad; and, Ascent Phase which begins with liftoff 
from the pad and continues until approximately OMS-2 burn. During the Pre-
Launch Phase, the Space Shuttle icon simply remains on the selected launch 
pad at Cape Canaveral as the clock counts down. No ground track or circle 
of visibility is drawn for the orbiter and the usual "on-orbit data" are 
neither calculated nor displayed. Since many of the parameters displayed 
are referenced to inertial coordinate systems (Earth Centered Inertial 
[XYZ] or Equatorial [RA/DEC], etc.) which take into account the rotation of 
the Earth, these data will change with time even though the orbiter is 
stationary! At approximately ten minutes prior to liftoff, STSPLUS 
calculates and plots the ground track for the ascent phase and the next 
several orbits.
     For those who may be interested, the geodetic coordinates and 
elevation above Mean Sea Level (Inertial Measurement Unit position in the 
orbiter) for the two Space Shuttle launch pads at Cape Canaveral are:

          Pad 39A
               PadLat =  28.6080 N
               PadLon = -80.6041 W
               PadElv =  62.484  meters

          Pad 39B
               PadLat =  28.6272 N
               PadLon = -80.6208 W
               PadElv =  64.244  meters

If the launch pad is unknown, select either one since the difference in 
orbit trajectory is essentially negligible. The launch pads are plotted on 
orthographic projections (only) with MAG=2000 or greater. They are 
unlabeled because of their close proximity to each other and to Cape 
Canaveral.
     At T=0, STSPLUS begins using its internal Ascent Phase logic to 
simulate liftoff, the powered portion of ascent, and the coasting portion 
of ascent to apogee and the OMS-2 burn. While based upon actual orbital 
ascent data, the Ascent Phase is only a very rough approximation for any 
given flight. The internal ascent model, adjusted for the planned altitude 
and orbital inclination, is used exclusively until after MECO (Main Engine 
Cutoff, which occurs about 8 minutes after launch). From MECO until OMS-2, 
STSPLUS begins a gradual transition from its internal model to the standard 
NORAD SGP4 orbital model which uses the estimated pre-launch TLEs. From 
OMS-2 on, only the NORAD SGP4 model and the TLEs are used. During the 
Ascent Phase, all the usual orbital data are calculated and displayed.
     All users are cautioned that the internal model is very approximate 
and is intended only to provide a reasonably realistic transition from the 
launch pad to orbit without trying to exactly duplicate all of the data for 
a specific ascent trajectory. The displayed data are representative but NOT 
exact. Actual ascent trajectories vary considerably as a function of 
payload, orbital altitude, orbital inclination, and to a lesser extent 
other factors such as winds aloft. The internal ascent model from my 
original STSORBIT program, supplemented by numeric ascent data supplied by 
Willie Musty of Rockwell Mission Support, has been adapted for this Špurpose. My thanks to Willie for his assistance in developing the current 
ascent model!
     In order to use the STSPLUS launch simulation, accurate estimated pre-
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 79


launch TLEs and launch time are REQUIRED. Estimated pre-launch TLEs are 
valid for a specific launch time ONLY; a launch delay requires new 
estimated TLEs. (For most but not all missions, new TLEs may be calculated 
from the original TLEs and launch date and time using my program ADJ2LINE. 
Rendezvous missions are an example of missions where ADJ2LINE cannot be 
used to recalculate estimated TLEs.) The following is a sample for the STS-
67 ASTRO-2 Mission in early March of 1995:

The Launch date and time are specifically identified and must not be 
confused with the Epoch Time (which is the instant for which the orbital 
data have been calculated). Note that the orbiter has been assigned a dummy 
NORAD (Catalog) number (99967) and no International Designation because the 
launch has not yet actually taken place. The data in the example are given 
as 2-Line Elements (TLEs) and in a "plain English" format to satisfy the 
needs of various user; STSPLUS uses only the TLE format. The estimated pre-
launch data are usually available several weeks prior to the launch on NASA 
Spacelink and my own home page as well as various other sources.

Launch Simulation Setup
-----------------------

     In order to generate a Space Shuttle Launch Simulation, STSPLUS must 
be set up correctly. Note that the Launch Simulation model is only 
available for Space Shuttle launches from Cape Canaveral, Florida; use of 
Launch Simulation under any other circumstances may yield unpredictable 
results! The following procedure will guide the user through the proper 
setup process.

1.   Obtain estimated pre-launch estimated 2-line elements (TLEs) for the 
     mission. Using an ordinary ASCII editor if necessary, make sure that 
     the first line of data in the file is the mission name ("STS-67" in 
     the example above. This step is to ensure that the TLEs can be read by 
     STSPLUS. (The TLEs may also be available separately, already formatted 
     for use by STSPLUS and similar tracking programs.) The following 
     example illustrates the (edited) TLE format for the estimated orbit 
     which consists of the three lines between the dashed lines:

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     STS-67
     1 99967U          95061.32643015  .00011689  00000-0  86071-4 0    43
     2 99967  28.4675  88.9985 0004519 287.7960  72.2100 15.71297841    28
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The length of the first line is variable, usually less than 20 
     characters, and identifies the mission. The second and third lines 
     contain the orbital data and must be exactly 69 characters long. There 
     must be no spurious characters or lines, and each line should be 
     terminated by the CR and LF characters. Provided the TLE data are the 
     first three lines in a file, additional lines of text or other data 
     may follow; such a file will be read correctly by STSPLUS.

     Following launch, the actual NORAD number and International 
     Designation are assigned and real orbital data are given, illustrated 
     by TLEs from another mission:

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     STS-66
     1 23340U 94073A   94317.54483356  .00013187  72758-9  36062-4 0   199
     2 23340  56.9893 152.3330 0012220 307.6197 288.0410 15.93309153  1587
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Note the NORAD Number ("23340") and International Designation 
     ("94073A", which means Year 1994, Satellite 73, First Object assigned.

2.   Place the file in the 2-line elements directory specified for STSPLUS. 
     Check the directory using F7 from the STSPLUS Main Menu if necessary.

3.   Note the planned launch time ("02 MAR 95  06:37 UTC" in the example).

4.   Start STSPLUS with the DOS command "STSPLUS". Do NOT use the "/R" Š     command line parameter at this time.

5.   From the STSPLUS Main Menu, press F2 to select 2-line elements. When 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 81


     prompted enter the filename for the estimated pre-launch 2-line 
     elements, followed by "STS" to select the Space Shuttle as the 
     satellite. The orbital data will be displayed on the screen. Press 
     ENTER to accept the data. The ground track map will be drawn.

6.   When map drawing has been completed, press ENTER to return to the Main 
     Menu.

7.   From the Main Menu, press F5 to select Launch Time and Date. You will 
     be prompted to enter the time, "06:37U" for the example. Be sure to 
     include the trailing "U" in this example to signify that the time is 
     UTC = Coordinated Universal Time, formerly known as Greenwich Mean 
     Time; you may substitute "G" in place of "U" if you wish STSPLUS to 
     use the abbreviation "GMT" instead of "UTC". You will next be prompted 
     to enter the date, "03/02/1995" [US date style] or "02.03.1995" 
     [European date style] for the example. The year may be shortened to 
     "95" if desired and leading zeroes may be omitted; "3/2/95" will be 
     interpreted the same as "03/02/1995".

Up to this point, the procedure is identical to setting the launch time and 
date for any satellite so as to be able to display Mission Elapsed Time 
(MET). The following step allows you to select Launch Simulation or normal 
operation.

8.   Finally, you will be prompted to select the Launch Site. Enter "1" 
     to select Launch Simulation from Pad 39A at Cape Canaveral, or "2" to 
     select Launch Pad 39B. If the launch pad is not known, use either "1" 
     or "2" since the two launch pads are relatively close to each other. 
     (Entering "0" will disable launch simulation and should be used for 
     all other satellites and missions.)

9.   Verify the time, date, and launch site information, then press ENTER 
     to accept the data or SPACE to repeat. To save these data for 
     subsequent use, press "Y" when asked if you wish to append this data 
     to file STSPLUS.LTD. The program will return to the Main Menu.

10.  From this point on, selecting this mission (by name or NORAD number) 
     will use Launch Simulation until after the OMS-2 burn.

Some time after launch (usually well after the OMS-2 burn), the mission 
will be assigned a NORAD number and an International Designation. The 
actual launch time may vary from the planned launch time! TLEs released 
after that time will carry the correct NORAD number and STSPLUS must be 
reconfigured for that information by REPEATING STEPS 1 THROUGH 10 to re-
enter the launch time, date, and launch site and cause them to be assigned 
to the actual NORAD number. Once the mission has passed the OMS-2 burn, 
Launch Simulation may be disabled.

Satellite Communications and Amateur Radio
------------------------------------------

     By now, everyone is familiar with communications satellites. They 
provide almost instant communications, particularly television, around the 
globe from their assigned geostationary "parking slots" some 22,300 miles 
above the surface of the Earth. The concept of the geostationary 
communications satellite was originated by the science fiction writer 
Arthur C, Clarke some thirty-odd years ago. Novel and revolutionary at the 
time, they have become an accepted part of global communications, all but 
taken for granted by the millions of people who see the images they 
transmit over vast distances. Glossing over some of the "minor 
technological details" that make these miracles possible, the 
communications satellite is relatively easy to use. Because of its 
geostationary orbit (which matches its orbital velocity with the Earth's 
rate of rotation), it appears to remain at the same point in the sky. Once 
properly located, ground terminals may be more or less permanently aimed 
and that's that. Reliable communications are routine except during the 
semi-annual Sun blockage periods when the Sun, satellite, and ground 
terminal are in a direct line with each other and the Sun's powerful 
radiation overwhelms the signals from the satellite.
     However, geostationary communications satellites are but one example
of the uses for satellite communications. Except for a relatively few 
passive satellites, each satellite has on board radio transmitters and 
receivers so that its ground control centers may send commands and receive 
data; these commands and data provide for the operational control and 
orbital position and stability of the satellite. Unlike the geostationary 
communications satellites, these satellites are in orbits which cause them 
to appear to move rapidly across the sky when viewed from the ground. The 
typical effective ground speed of the space shuttle, for example, is some 
17,500 miles per hour; other satellites in higher orbits move more slowly. 
Viewed from afar, both the ground station and the satellite are moving 
rapidly, sometimes toward each other and sometimes away, as a result of the 
rotation of the Earth and orbital direction/velocity respectively.
     Since the typical satellite's receiver(s) and transmitter(s) are 
usually set for fixed frequencies, these high relative velocities cause a 
problem on the ground known as Doppler Shift. Almost everyone has heard a 
train whistle as it speeds past; the whistle's pitch is high when first 
heard, then drops steadily as the train passes. The "true" pitch of the 
whistle is heard when the train is opposite the listener. While the train 
is approaching the pitch is shifted to a higher frequency, and as the train 
recedes the pitch is shifted to a lower frequency. For satellite 
communications, this effect is increased by the much higher relative 
velocities involved and it is usually necessary to adjust the transmit and 
receive frequencies on the ground to compensate for the shift.
     Stated simply, the ground station must adjust its transmitting 
frequency such that the shifted frequency as received by the satellite is 
the exact frequency for which the satellite receiver is set. Similarly, the 
ground station must adjust its receiver frequency to the shifted frequency 
at which the satellite's signal will be received. Like the train whistle, 
the ground station's transmit and receive frequencies are constantly 
changing as the satellite approaches and then departs from the ground Šstation. As a general rule, no two satellite passes over a ground station 
have exactly the same geometry and therefore these frequency shift 
adjustments must be calculated dynamically for each pass. In the special 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 83


case of Frequency Modulation (FM) transmissions using a receiver with 
Automatic Frequency Control (AFC) and a sufficiently wide receiver AFC 
bandwidth, no adjustments may be necessary.
     Given a satellite's orbital parameters and the appropriate computer 
software, these data can be calculated in advance of an upcoming pass as 
well as in real time. Most of the required data are already calculated in 
satellite tracking software such as STSPLUS. Ken Ernandes, N2WWD, offered 
his expertise and amateur radio equipment to assist in the implementation 
and test of Doppler Shift calculations in STSPLUS. The necessary changes 
and additions to the software were implemented in mid-March 1994 and Ken 
made a preliminary test using Radio Sputnik 10 (RS-10, a piggybacked 
transponder on the Russian COSMOS 1861 satellite, NORAD #18129). To our 
considerable surprise and delight, the very first test was a complete 
success; although the satellite only reached a maximum of 7 degrees above 
the ground station's horizon, the transponder signal was heard (rather weak 
and noisy) on the predicted frequency. Although we both were confident in 
our mathematical solution to the Doppler shift problem, it is seldom that 
such calculations turn out to be correct on the first try! Testing and 
validation continue.

STSPLUS Doppler Shift Mode
--------------------------

     STSPLUS' Doppler Shift Mode of operation may be used for real time
communications with any satellite, not just amateur radio transponders, for 
which orbital data ("2-line elements" or "TLE") are available. For each 
satellite, the user prepares a preset frequency list in file STSPLUS.FRQ 
which includes the satellite's NORAD Number, the transmit (XMIT) and 
receive (RECV) center frequencies, and a special code which is used to 
select NORMAL or INVERTED satellite transmitter transponders (see below). 
For satellites with fixed transmit and receive frequencies, that is 
all that is required; for satellites which receive and transmit over a band 
of frequencies, such as the passbands of the typical amateur radio repeater 
transponder, the receive and transmit frequencies may be quickly "tuned" in 
tandem by fine increments of 100 Hz or coarse increments of 1 KHz over the 
entire passband.
     For those who may be interested, the solution of the Doppler shift 
computations required that the ground station position vector and the 
satellite position and velocity vectors be calculated using standard 
transformation algorithms (and the SGP4 Orbital Model for determining the 
satellite data), then converted to Earth-Fixed Greenwich ("EFG") 
coordinates, a geocentric inertial coordinate system using the WGS-72 
Geodetic Model. From these data the relative velocity and frequency shift 
ratios are next calculated. These ratios are then applied to the preset 
transmit and receive center frequencies to yield the shifted frequencies, 
all of which are then displayed to the user. Provided the computer is 
equipped with a math coprocessor chip, all data are updated each second. 
The following is an example of the frequency data displayed as a satellite 
(RS-10 in the example) approaches the ground station:

        UpLink:   145.8900    Uplink frequency received by satellite
          XMIT:   145.8880    TRANSMIT frequency at ground stationŠ        DnLink:    29.3900    Downlink frequency xmitted by satellite
          RECV:    29.3904    RECEIVE frequency at ground station

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 84


The shifted transmit frequency (XMIT) and receive frequency (RECV) are 
also color coded to indicate the signal status: 

     RED       The satellite is below the receiver horizon; communications 
               are normally not possible.

     YELLOW    The satellite is from zero to five degrees above the 
               receiver horizon; transmissions MAY be possible.

     GREEN     The satellite is five degrees or more above the receiver 
               horizon; transmissions should be practical if the receiver 
               horizon is clear in the direction of the satellite.

     The altitude (or elevation) of the satellite above the receiver 
horizon is usually a good indicator of communications capability. However, 
transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, antenna structure and orientation, 
and atmospheric conditions all play a role in making reliable full duplex 
communications practical. For example, the large antennas used by the DOD 
C-Band Radar Network, used to track the orbiter and other satellites during 
ascent and critical maneuvers, typically acquire signal lock when the 
satellite is between 3 and 4 degrees above the local horizon. A low power 
amateur radio rig may require that the satellite be from 5 to 8 degrees 
above the local horizon for reliable communications. To illustrate the role 
atmospheric conditions may play, the space-based geostationary TDRS 
(Tracking and Data Relay Satellite) typically acquires signal lock with a 
target satellite at or near Earth limb (what passes for the "horizon" at 
the satellite). In addition to the frequency data, the ground station 
("STN") times for Acquisition of Signal ("AOS") and Loss of Signal ("LOS"), 
calculated for the true ground station horizon, are displayed so that the 
user may quickly determine how soon a pass will begin or how much time 
remains in a current pass.
     For ground station to satellite communications, operation is 
straightforward. The user simply adjusts his transmit ("XMIT") and receive 
("RECV") frequencies to those shown by STSPLUS as the satellite passes his 
location. Since the frequencies required at the satellite are known and do 
not change, there are no "fine tuning" adjustments required.
     Compared to a satellite with fixed receive and transmit frequencies, 
the typical amateur radio satellite transponder (also referred to as a 
"crossband repeater") presents a slightly more complex situation. The 
transponder receives signals across a passband of frequencies (20 to 80 KHz 
are typical bandwidths), then retransmits the received signals across a 
passband of the same width but centered at a different frequency. The 
center frequency of the receive and transmit passbands are known in advance 
but may change from time to time depending upon the transponder mode (CW, 
voice, digital packet, etc.). The transmit side of the transponder may also 
operate in either NORMAL or INVERTED mode. That is, for NORMAL mode the 
transmitted signal is the same frequency above or below the center 
frequency as is the received signal; for INVERTED mode, the transmitted 
signal is the same frequency above (below) the transmit center frequency as 
the received signal is below (above) the receive center frequency.
     STSPLUS addresses this situation in two ways. First, once the user has 
received a signal of interest, he uses the PgUp, PgDn, UP, and DOWN keys to Š"fine tune" the downlink frequency shown by STSPLUS ("RECV") until it 
matches the actual received frequency. PgUp and PgDn perform "coarse 
tuning" in increments of 1 KHz, and UP and DOWN perform "fine tuning" in 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 85


increments of 100 Hz. The response is quite rapid and the fine tuning may 
usually be performed in no more than several seconds. STSPLUS then makes 
the necessary calculations to show the required uplink frequency ("XMIT") 
to permit full duplex communications. The second part of the problem is the 
transponder mode; STSPLUS selects NORMAL or INVERTED transponder mode based 
upon the mode parameter supplied by the user in file STSPLUS.FRQ: 1 = 
NORMAL, -1 = INVERTED.

Normal and Complementary Azimuth/Elevation Tracking
---------------------------------------------------

     Normal Elevation and Azimuth tracking shows the sighting angles 
(antenna pointing angles) for degrees above the horizon (Elevation) and 
direction (0 to 360 degrees in the sense NESW) at the user's location. This 
is quite satisfactory for visual sightings and for most amateur radio 
contacts. Ken Ernandes, N2WWD, requested that complementary (or inverted) 
tracking be added for passes occuring near the antenna stops at the North 
or South (depending upon antenna setup).
     The complementary Elevation and Azimuth tracking feature has been 
implemented to accommodate the hardware limitation in most two-axis antenna 
drives. The most popular amateur antenna rotors provide a full 360 degrees 
of azimuth coverage but have a "stop" point that does not allow "through" 
tracking; this "stop" is usually at North or South. If the stop is 
encountered in the middle of a satellite pass, tracking must cease while 
the antenna is rotated through 360 degrees, a process which can take up to 
one minute and is a significant portion of a typical 8 to 10 minute Mir or 
Space Shuttle pass. The stop limitation can be at least an inconvenience in 
other longer duration passes.
     Inverted Elevation and Azimuth tracking overcomes the inconvenience of 
the azimuth stop by effectively "flipping" the aziumth stop 180 degrees. 
Satellite tracking continues because of tracking equivalent pointing 
directions. The equivalent pointing directions are established by tracking 
inverted azimuth and elevation angles calculated as described below. When 
inverted tracking is in use, the satellite's elevation may be an angle 
greater than 180 degrees. In this case the rotor should be set to 180 
degrees and remain there as the satellite approaches the user's horizon. 
Once the satellite breaks the horizon (at an elevation of 180 degrees), it 
may they be tracked using the complementary azimuth and elevation angles on 
the STSPLUS display. [Those interested can do a quick check of 
trigonometric identities to mathematically prove the equivalence of the 
inverted tracking.]
     The complementary Elevation and Azimuth satellite coordinates are 
selected using F10+F4 from the Main Menu (second F4 keypress with "E/A" 
displayed) or using F10 while the map is displayed. The coordinates in the 
complementary mode are shown with labels in YELLOW to alert the user and 
are labeled as "CEl" and "CAz". The complementary coordinates are 
calculated as follows:

          CEl = El - 180
          CAz = (Az + 180) MOD 360

     Satellite tracking using complementary azimuth and elevation angles Šmay be illustrated by an example. Suppose a station with the azimuth stop 
at the South wishes to track the Space Shuttle or Mir. The STSPLUS graphic 
display shows that the pass of interest moves through the station's stop in 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 86


the southern sky. Using the complementary or inverted tracking option, the 
station "flips" the azimuth and elevation angle display in STSPLUS. 
Following the complementary angles on the STSPLUS display effectively moves 
the stop to the North and allows continuous tracking throughout the pass.

Satellite Phase (Mean Anomaly)
------------------------------

     Some amateur satellite transponders (an example is AO-13) change their 
mode of operation based upon a parameter called "phase". Data is published 
by AmSat and/or others for these transponders giving the mode of operation 
for specific ranges of Phase. Phase is the Mean Anomaly, one of the six 
parameters of orbital data, normalized to the range from 0 to 255. Phase = 
0 (Mean Anomaly = 0 degrees) corresponds to perigee, the point at which the 
satellite's orbit makes its closest approach to the center of the Earth 
(NOT the surface!); Phase = 128 (Mean Anomaly = 180 degrees) corresponds to 
apogee, the point in the orbit at which the satellite is most distant from 
the center of the Earth.
     When the Doppler Shift Mode is enabled in orthographic projection (by 
pressing F8 while the map is displayed), the Phase is displayed PROVIDED 
that the Eccentricity is greater than or equal to 0.005:

          Phase:       123.9

When the conditions for the display of Phase data are met, it replaces the 
orbital period data ("Per'd") in the Doppler Shift Mode; if not, the 
orbital period data will be displayed. Technically, Phase is defined as an 
integer in the range 0 to 255. However, in order to give the user some 
advance warning when the Phase will step from one number to the next, 
STSPLUS also displays the first decimal digit. Phase is NOT displayed in 
rectangular projections due to insufficient display space.

TECHNICAL NOTES REGARDING PHASE:

1.   The Mean Anomaly is dynamically calculated by the SGP4 algorithm 
     within STSPLUS. This value (in radians) is divided by (2 * PI) and the 
     result multiplied by 256 to obtain Phase. The Phase is then displayed 
     as a number ranging from 0.0 to 255.9. The technical definition of 
     Phase is as an integer ranging from 0 to 255 (so as to fit in a single 
     8-bit byte of computer data).

2.   Phase is calculated based upon geocentric (center of the Earth) data 
     rather than geodetic (surface of the Earth taking into account the 
     shape of the Earth) data. What may appear as an apogee or perigee 
     based upon "Elv", the distance above Mean Sea Level, may NOT be the 
     actual apogee or perigee when calculated using geocentric data. 
     Because of the shape of the Earth, these distances may vary up to 21 
     kilometers from the Equator to a pole. 

3.   Mean Anomaly (and therefore Phase) is undefined for a perfectly 
     circular orbit; there is no perigee or apogee in this situation. In 
     addition, some uncertainties are also introduced by gravitational Š     variations which can make accurate dynamic determination of apogee or 
     perigee difficult for low Earth orbits. These variations and 
     inaccuracies become significant for orbits with an Eccentricity of 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 87


     0.005 or less, a situation which is typical for most low Earth orbits. 
     For this and other reasons, amateur satellites in low Earth orbits do 
     not use Phase to determine operating modes.

4.   The following conditions are required for the Phase data to be 
     displayed:

     a)   The orthographic projection has been selected by pressing "O" 
          while the map is displayed.

     b)   The Doppler Shift Mode has been selected using F8 while the map 
          is displayed. 

     c)   The Eccentricity of the satellite's orbit is 0.005 or greater.

     If any of these three conditions is not satisfied, the orbital period 
     data ("Per'd") will be displayed.

     NOTE: Neither the orbital period nor the phase is displayed in the 
     rectangular projection.

Satellite Communications Technique and Cautions
-----------------------------------------------

     Once full duplex communications have been established, remaining "in 
lock" throughout a pass requires that both parties continually adjust their 
transmit and receive frequencies to the values displayed by STSPLUS to the 
extent practical and consistent with the bandwidth capabilities of their 
receivers. Although this may seem a bit daunting at first, the actual rate 
of change of the frequencies is sufficiently slow that it can easily be 
managed by the relative novice with a little practice.
     Equally important in the relatively new area of communications with or 
via manned and unmanned satellites is that all participants recognize that 
the available bandwidth and communications opportunities are a "scarce 
resource" that must be used with care and shared. This is in keeping with 
long standing amateur radio tradition. The problem can be particularly 
difficult with the manned spacecraft, MIR and the Space Shuttle. Careful 
attention to doppler shift can be of considerable help in completing the 
call by using the correct frequency or frequencies.

                           ********************
                           *  IMPORTANT NOTE  *
                           ********************

     Experience with communications via amateur ratio satellites such as 
RS-10 has shown that careful test and calibration of the receiver and 
transmitter are essential to successful communications. For example, an 
error or bias of 2 or 3 KHz on the receiver frequency can make the 
difference between a successful call and a failure. If the receiver or 
transmitter has a consistent bias, it may be possible to temporarily adjust 
the values of the center frequencies to compensate for the problem but the 
best solution, of course, is to have the equipment calibrated and operating Šcorrectly.
     Equally important, the computer clock must be accurately set. Radio 
time signals such as those broadcast by the National Institute of Standards 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 88


and Technology (NIST) on WWV are sufficiently accurate for this purpose. 
     Finally, the frequencies calculated by STSPLUS are no more accurate 
than the orbital data used. For the typical amateur radio satellite, the 
orbital data should be no more than a week old for reasonable results. If 
the satellite is performing orbital maneuvers (as MIR does from time to 
time), only the most current elements will yield satisfactory results. 
Sources such NASA Spacelink, NASA GSFC Orbital Information Group, and my 
own home page offer up-to-date 2-line elements for all or most of the 
common amateur radio satellites. Since the amateur radio transponders are 
often "piggybacked" on a primary satellite, the name of the satellite used 
by these sources may be different from the amateur radio designation. Use 
the example file STSPLUS.FRQ to check for the NORAD numbers of common 
amateur radio satellites and use the NORAD number rather than a satellite 
name or designation when searching for TLEs.

Preparing File STSPLUS.FRQ for Amateur Radio Use
------------------------------------------------

     File STSPLUS.FRQ contains the parameters required for STSPLUS to 
operate in the Doppler Shift Mode. Each entry (line) in the file includes 
the satellite NORAD Number, UPLINK and DOWNLINK center frequencies, and the 
transponder mode, specified in that order, separated by commas and without 
any leading or trailing spaces. The following format is used for each 
entry:

        00000,100,100,1           (Default values if sat not included)

        18129,145.8900,29.3900,1  (Parameters for NORAD #18129)
        --+-- ----+--- ---+--- +
          |       |       |    |
          |       |       |    +-- Transponder Mode:  1 = NORMAL
          |       |       |                          -1 = INVERTED
          |       |       |
          |       |       +------- DownLink Center Frequency (MHz)
          |       |
          |       +--------------- UpLink Center Frequency (MHz)
          |
          +----------------------- Satellite NORAD Number

The first sample line shows the "00000" entry which determines the default 
values if the satellite is NOT included in file STSPLUS.FRQ. This should be 
the FIRST LINE in file STSPLUS.FRQ. The second line gives real parameters 
for a specific satellite; the frequencies shown select the Mode A voice 
passband for Radio Sputnik 10 (RS-10, piggybacked on COSMOS 1861, NORAD 
#18129). Preset frequencies may range from 1.0000 MHz to 99000.0000 MHz. 
Neither the uplink nor downlink frequency should exceed approximately 
99000.0000 MHz to avoid an overflow condition on the display. Although the 
center frequencies are shown above in MHz, any desired units may be used 
since STSPLUS simply calculates a ratio and displays the results with four 
digits to the right of the decimal point.
     File STSPLUS.FRQ may be created or edited with any ASCII editor; word 
processor users, use the "non-document" mode. Note that only minimum error 
checking is performed and the user must observe the required format exactly 
for each line in the file. Up to ten entries may be included for a given 
satellite (using the same NORAD Number) in order of preference. If more 
than one entry is present for the current satellite, the user is presented 
with a list and asked to make a choice.
     Ken Ernandes, N2WWD, in conjunction with his tests of STSPLUS' Doppler 
Shift Mode, has prepared a preliminary STSPLUS.FRQ file with the current 
(as of March, 1994) center frequencies of fourteen amateur radio 
satellites. Note that several satellites have more than one entry, 
corresponding to different modes of operation:

          00000,100,100,1                    (Default values)
          14129,435.1025,145.9025,-1         (AO-10)
          16609,145.5500,145.5500,1          (MIR)
          18129,145.8850,29.3800,1           (RS-10)Š          18129,21.1800,145.8800,1

     NOTE: The center frequencies listed above are preliminary, based upon 
     available information. For example, the uplink frequencies for the 
     first entry for RS-10 and the entry for FO-20 have been adjusted up by 
     5KHz to compensate for an apparent transponder bias. These data will 
     be coordinated by Ken Ernandes, N2WWD. Ken may be contacted via e-mail 
     at n2wwd@mindspring.com. Users who have carefully calibrated their 
     receivers and transmitters and who have updated information are 
     encouraged to contact Ken.

     SAREX, the Shuttle Amateur Radio EXperiment, is frequently assigned to 
Space Shuttle flights. The following uplink and downlink frequencies have 
been assigned for that flight (data as of April 1994):

     NASA adds the following note with respect to the voice uplink: "The 
astronauts will not favor any one of the above frequencies. Therefore, the 
ability to talk with an astronaut depends on selecting one of the above 
frequencies chosen by the astronaut." (Information courtesy NASA Spacelink 
as of April, 1994) Thus, for a station in North America, the user may add Šthe following entries to file STSPLUS.FRQ:

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 91


          00059,144.91,145.55,1
          00059,144.93,145.55,1

          00059,144.99,145.55,1
          00059,144.49,145.55,1

where "00059" must be replaced by the actual NORAD number assigned to the 
flight. A temporary NORAD number corresponding to the flight number, 
illustrated by "00059" in the example above, is usually used until the 
permanent NORAD number is assigned (although some sources use a different 
method to assign a temporary NORAD number -- check the TLEs). However, if a 
temporary NORAD number is used during the initial portion of the flight, 
the data in file STSPLUS.FRQ must later be updated to the permanent NORAD 
number when that number is used in the TLEs in order for STSPLUS to 
recognize the flight's frequency list. A typical set of TLEs for a Space 
Shuttle are shown with the NORAD number and Eccentricity noted:

     Because different sources of 2-line elements (TLEs) may use different 
names for the same satellite, numerous satellites may have similar names, 
and some payloads (especially amateur radio transponders) are "piggybacked" 
on a primary satellite with a different name, always use the NORAD Number 
if possible when searching a file for the TLEs. The MIR Space Station, 
NORAD Number #16609, can be mistaken for numerous MIR debris objects ("DEB" 
or "D" appears in the first line of the TLEs). For AO-13, for example, 
press F2, select the desired TLE filename, then enter "#19216" (without the 
quotation marks but WITH the pound sign) as the satellite name. This method 
will ALWAYS find the data if they are present in the file. Once the data 
are found, STSPLUS displays them as usual. If there is only one entry in 
file STSPLUS.FRQ for the satellite, STSPLUS will immediately draw the map 
after ENTER is pressed to approve the satellite and its data. However, if 
more than one entry for the satellite is present, and STSPLUS is currently 
in the Doppler Shift Mode, STSPLUS will display a list of the available 
preset frequencies and request the user to select one:

Enter the desired preset frequency selection number followed by ENTER. If 
you wish selection #1, you may simply press ENTER. Entering a number less 
than 1 or greater than the highest selection number will also pick 
selection #1.
     Note that when STSPLUS is NOT in the Doppler Shift Mode, no list of 
preset frequency selections is displayed and STSPLUS automatically picks 
selection #1 (to avoid bothering folks who are not interested in the 
Doppler Shift Mode).

ACTIVE KEYS DURING GROUND TRACK DISPLAY
---------------------------------------

     The following table lists the various keys which are active when the 
ground track display is shown on the screen. Some of these features are 
more fully described elsewhere.

   ENTER  Return to Main Menu (cancel the simulation).

      F1  On-line HELP. Press F1 to display a help screen in the lower 
          portion of the screen. Press F1 again to resume normal data 
          display.

      F2  Selects the Big Clock mode. These modes are selected in the 
          following order:

               0    No clock displayed
               1    UTC date and time
               2    Local date and time
               3    STN/TDRS AOS/LOS and MET or T+Epoch (select with F5)

          Note that not all computers (especially older CGA systems) will 
          display the extended graphics characters used for the large clock 
          characters. The symptom of this problem is that the lower left 
          portion of the data block is mostly blank after pressing F2. If 
          you have this problem and your computer is running DOS 3.x or DOS 
          5.0, enter the command "GRAFTABL" at the DOS prompt before 
          running STSPLUS or include the line "GRAFTABL" in your 
          AUTOEXEC.BAT file; this sets the "code page" to enable the 
          computer to display the extended graphics characters. [The 
          program GRAFTABL.COM is included as part of DOS in most cases.]

      F3  Enable or disable printer logging. If logging is enabled, the 
          word LOG appears in the lower right of the screen. Be sure the 
          printer is turned on BEFORE using the F3 command. The F3 command 
          automatically enables the display of ascending and descending 
          node information.

      F4  Toggle FAST mode from x1 to x10 to x60 to x1, etc. When either of 
          the fast modes is enabled, "(x10)" or "(x60)" will appear at the 
          upper left of the screen in red. This feature operates in both 
          the normal (real or simulated time) and PAUSE modes.

      F5  Switches the elapsed time between "T+Epoch" and "MET". If no 
          launch time and date have been entered, this command will have no 
          effect.

      F6  Enable PAUSE mode. The plot is frozen at the current position and 
          the "+" and "-" keys are enabled. The "=" key may be used instead 
          of the "+" key to avoid use of the SHIFT KEY. Press ENTER to 
          resume normal operation using the current simulated time. (NOTE: 
          To return to REAL TIME after the PAUSE mode, press ENTER after Š          leaving PAUSE to return to the Main Menu, then press F8+F1.)

      F7  Enable or disable the spacecraft circle of visibility.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 94



      F8  Switches program operation between NORMAL and DOPPLER SHIFT 
          modes. (Orthographic projection only; see text for details.)

      F9  Change units of distance between kilometers (km), nautical miles 
          (nm), and statute miles (sm).

     F10  Change satellite coordinates between Altitude/Elevation and 
          Azimuth (Topocentric) in either NORMAL or COMPLEMENTARY mode (see 
          the notes under Set Satellite Coordinates for details), Right 
          Ascension and Declination (Equatorial), and X-Y-Z (Geocentric 
          Rectangular, also known as ECI or Earth-Centered Inertial) 
          coordinate systems. If a Target Satellite has been selected, F10 
          may also be used to display Relative Range and Velocity between 
          the Primary and Target Satellites. See the section "Normal and 
          Complementary Azimuth/Elevation Tracking" for further details.

     F11  (WINDOWS 95/98 ONLY) Activate program STSUPDAT to update all TLEs 
          currently in use by STSPLUS. Requires an active Internet 
          connection prior to execution of STSPLUS. Pressing CTRL-F2 also 
          invokes program STSUPDAT in a slightly different mode. See the 
          section "Using STSPLUS with program STSUPDAT by Greg Swift" for 
          additional information.

     F12  Select units of display for AOS and LOS. Cycles through countdown 
          clocks, UTC time, local time, and MET. If launch time has not 
          been set, MET AOS/LOS times will NOT be available.

       *  Write STSPLUS.PCX image file of current tracking map. Available 
          only for VGA and EGA display adapters. (See also Maim Menu, "F4 
          Enable/Disable PCX Image File Generation", for additional 
          discussion.)

     +/=  During PAUSE mode only, "+" moves the satellite to the NEXT 
          calculated position based upon the FAST mode then in effect: 
          simulated time is advanced 1, 10, or 60 seconds. The "=" key may 
          be used instead of "+" to avoid use of the SHIFT KEY.

       -  During PAUSE mode only, "-" moves the satellite to the PREVIOUS 
          calculated position based upon the FAST mode then in effect: 
          simulated time is backed up 1, 10, or 60 seconds.

     TAB  In rectangular map modes only, enable or disable automatic map 
          generation. Automatic map generation is ALWAYS enabled in 
          orthographic modes. When automatic map generation is enabled in 
          rectangular map modes, the letter "A" will appear in the upper 
          right of the display screen. Pressing the TAB key will always 
          cause the map to be redrawn.

    PgUp  NORMAL OPERATION: When in one of the zoom modes, increases the 
          field of view (decreases MAG) up to a maximum of 180 degrees. 
          Press rapidly to execute multiple zoom steps without redrawing Š          the map for each keypress.

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Increases the "RECV" frequency by 1 KHz. Hold 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 95


          down or press rapidly for large frequency changes.

    PgDn  NORMAL OPERATION: When in one of the zoom modes, decreases the 
          field of view (increases MAG) down to a minimum of 30 degrees. 
          Press rapidly to execute multiple zoom steps without redrawing 
          the map for each keypress.

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Decreases the "RECV" frequency by 1 KHz. Hold 
          down or press rapidly for large frequency changes.

    Home  NORMAL OPERATION: When in one of the zoom modes, returns the 
          field of view to 75 degrees (rectangular projections) or the full 
          globe (orthographic projections).

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Restores the UpLink and DnLink center 
          frequencies to the original values read from file STSPLUS.FRQ.

     End  NORMAL OPERATION: When in one of the zoom modes, returns the 
          field of view to the last zoom factor used prior to pressing the 
          HOME key.

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: (not used and inactive)

      UP  NORMAL OPERATION: (not used and inactive)

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Increases the "RECV" frequency by 100 Hz. 
          Hold down or press rapidly for larger frequency changes.

    DOWN  NORMAL OPERATION: (not used and inactive)

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Decreases the "RECV" frequency by 100 Hz. 
          Hold down or press rapidly for larger frequency changes.
          
       B  Toggle the BLINK mode of the satellite symbol between blinking 
          and steady. NOTE: On most systems, the satellite symbol will 
          appear to blink very briefly as it is erased and redrawn even 
          when BLINK is OFF.

       O  Select Orthographic Projection (the LETTER "O" not the digit 
          zero). PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End are active to select the 
          magnification.

     W,0  Select World Map display, showing the full world from +85 degrees 
          North latitude to -85 degrees South latitude using rectangular 
          projection. If automatic map generation is disabled, pressing "W" 
          or "0" will toggle between the two world map displays.

       Q  Select Quadrant Map display, showing 180 degrees field of view 
          (rectangular projection) and selected so as to approximately 
          center the satellite.

      1-9 Select the indicated Quadrant Map. Automatic map generation is Š      !@# disabled when a specific quadrant map is selected. See the chart
          in the section Quadrant Maps for the map numbers.

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 96


       Z  Select Zoom Map display, showing from 180 to 30 degrees field of 
          view (rectangular projection) and selected so as to approximately 
          center the satellite. The default is 75 degrees.

       L  Select Location Map display, showing concentric isocontours for 
          your location. If a second location has been enabled, press "L" 
          again for that location.

          When the Location Map is displayed in orthographic projection, 
          the slash key "(/") may be used to enable user specified map 
          center. See the section Location Map with Specified Map Center 
          for additional information.

       T  Tracking Station Map display, showing concentric isocontours for 
          the tracking station closest to the current ground track position 
          of the satellite using the current projection. Uses the data in 
          the current TRACKING STATION file to select the tracking 
          station(s); if the file is not found, STSPLUS defaults to an 
          internal set of tracking stations. Use F7 from the Main Menu to 
          select the TRACKING STATION filename.

       M  Satellite Motion Map display, available on EGA and VGA systems 
          only. Displays a map with the satellite centered using the map 
          projection in effect when the key is pressed. In rectangular 
          modes, the map is shown in zoom. Maps are drawn "off screen" and 
          a complete map is always displayed. The map is updated every 10 
          seconds or as rapidly as the computer processor will permit. 
          While the Satellite Motion Map is displayed, the following keys 
          are active: ENTER, "M", "Home", "End", "PgUp", and "PgDn"; these 
          keys perform the same functions as during the normal display 
          except that the "M" key cancels the Satellite Motion Map and 
          returns to normal display.

       R  Redraw the map without returning to the Main Menu. This 
          immediately redraws the map (if it becomes cluttered or if the 
          user wishes to reposition the primary satellite). As an 
          incidental benefit of this method of redrawing, the Ascending and 
          Descending Node data is preserved when that feature is enabled.

  ALT-F1  Display orbital data for primary or secondary satellites.

  ALT-F2  Execute program GPSSYNC to determine/set current time and date 
          and to determine the current position (latitude, longutude, and 
          elevation). Requires program GPSSYNC, available for download from 
          my home page.

   ALT-R  Enable/Disable "Night Vision" mode. In "Night Vision" mode, all 
          screen colors are changed to either RED or LIGHT RED to protect 
          night vision adaptation. (ALT-R also operates at the Main Menu.)

Note that latitudes and longitudes also include "N" and "E" for positive 
values respectively, and "S" and "W" for negative values respectively. This 
convention, which may seem redundant, has been used to avoid possible 
confusion; there are a number of representations for latitude and longitude 
in common use which use different sign conventions. Azimuth (heading) is 
given in the sense North-East-South-West where North is 0 degrees, East is 
90 degrees, and so forth. The degree symbol is shown on the display for 
all angles but has been omitted from this documentation because it may not 
print correctly on all printers.

F1     STSPLUS Program Information
----------------------------------

     Function Key F1 displays information about program STSORBIT PLUS 
including the copyright notice, version number, and my name and address. 
Also shown is my Home Page and e-mail address on the Internet. The current 
version of STSORBIT PLUS is always posted at my Home Page.


F2     Read/Update NASA/NORAD 2-Line Elements from *.TXT/*.TLE Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------

     In order to read or update the NASA/NORAD 2-line elements, you must 
have a file with data for the appropriate satellites. A current file is 
included in the standard distribution of STSPLUS. These files have names 
such as "TLE360.TXT" where the "360" corresponds to the particular US Space 
Command Prediction Bulletin number from Dr. TS Kelso and are usually 
updated several times per week. This and other TLE files are available from 
my Home Page and from various sources on the Internet.
     Users are cautioned that some sources, including NASA Spacelink, use 
Unix or Macintosh systems to prepare and/or format the TLE data. UNIX uses 
the LF character (Line Feed) and Macintosh uses the CR (Carriage Return) 
as a single line terminator; DOS (and STSPLUS) use CR+LF (Carriage Return 
plus Line Feed) as a line terminator. Using a TLE file with incorrect line 
termination will usually cause STSPLUS to generate the error "Data problems 
with <filename>, check data format!". Some ASCII editors, such as the DOS 
shareware program QEDIT by SemWare Corp., will automatically reformat these
files to standard DOS format simply by reading and then saving the file.


     Select/Update Preset Frequency Selections
     -----------------------------------------

     STSPLUS reads file STSPLUS.FRQ for preset frequency selections for the 
current satellite each time the program is started. STSPLUS will re-read 
file STSPLUS.FRQ each time F2 is used to select or update the current 
primary satellite. When the Doppler Shift Mode is active (selected using F8 
while the orthographic map is displayed) and more than one preset frequency 
selection is available for the satellite, STSPLUS will present a list of 
available selections and the user may choose the desired selection. The 
following is a sample list of preset frequency selections for AO-13, NORAD 
#19216:

Š        Enter Desired Preset Frequency Selection Number [1]:

Enter the desired preset frequency selection number followed by ENTER. If 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 99


you wish selection #1, you may simply press ENTER. Entering a number less 
than 1 or greater than the highest selection number will also pick 
selection #1. If you wish to change your preset frequency selection, you 
must be in the Doppler Shift Mode -- press F8 while the map is displayed. 
Return to F2 on the Main Menu, re-select the desired satellite, then choose 
the desired preset frequency selection. See the section "Satellite 
Communications and Amateur Radio" for additional information on the Doppler 
Shift Mode.

     NOTE: When STSPLUS is NOT in the Doppler Shift Mode, no list of preset 
frequency selections is displayed and STSPLUS automatically picks selection 
#1 to avoid bothering folks who are not interested in the Doppler Shift 
Mode.


     Update Current TDRS and Real Time Satellites
     --------------------------------------------

     Once Secondary Satellites (TDRS, Static, and Real Time) have been 
selected (using F6+F1 from the Main Menu), it is necessary to periodically 
update the 2-line elements ("TLEs") for these satellites so that the 
calculated positions are accurate. Naturally, this is also true for the 
primary satellite being tracked. TLEs have a limited lifetime. For higher 
altitude satellites such as geosynchronous satellites, 4 to 8 weeks is 
probably sufficient unless the satellite is being maneuvered (although I 
usually do this task at least weekly since I have the data). For low Earth 
orbit satellites, even when the satellite is not being maneuvered, I 
recommend a maximum interval of about two weeks; if the satellite is being 
maneuvered, such as is usually the case with the Space Shuttle, daily 
updates may be required. The Secondary Satellite display (F6+F1) flags real 
time satellites whose elements are more than 10 days old, and static 
satellites whose elements are more than 60 days old.
     To update 2-line elements for the primary satellite and all Secondary 
Satellites, press F2 from the Main Menu and select the desired file as 
described in the following section. Then enter the satellite name as "&" to 
request TLE update mode. The TLE file will be scanned and all satellite 
TLEs will be updated if their Epoch Time is later than those presently 
stored. The entire process takes only a few seconds. The following prompt 
illustrates the "Update" selection:

          Select NASA/NORAD 2-Line Elements File

          Enter 2-Line Filename  [GSFC315.TXT]:     GSFC315.TXT
          Enter Satellite Name/#nnnnn  [#20638]:    &
          (Enter '*' to match any satellite name, '&' for AUTO UPDATE)

As STSPLUS updates TLEs, a list of the satellites for which new TLEs have 
been loaded is displayed:

          Automatic TLE updates for:

          Press any key to continue ...

The satellite number indicates the "slot" in the Secondary Satellite 
configuration, or "P" for the Primary Satellite. In the example shown, the 
TLEs for eight satellites were updated to the Epoch Times (YYDDD.DDDDDDDD) 
indicated. The satellites are listed in the order found in the TLE file. 
The updated TLEs will be saved in file STSPLUS.INI. Press ENTER to return 
to the Main Menu.


     Read NASA/NORAD 2-Line Elements from a File
     -------------------------------------------

     For both "Read" and "Update" functions, pressing F2 will display a 
list of all available files with default filetypes ".TXT" and ".TLE". The 
following example has been edited to show only 8 files:

     Select NASA/NORAD 2-Line Elements File

     Enter 2-Line Filename  [TLE147.TXT]:
     Use ARROW KEYS, press ENTER to use the current default file
     shown in square brackets [...], or press ESC to CANCEL.

      8 matching files in directory F:\TLE

     MIR.TLE
     TLE141.TXT
     TLE146.TXT
     TLE147.TXT

     The list of files is sorted in alphabetical order by filename then 
displayed using up to five columns. The display mode is adjusted for the 
maximum number of lines permissible for the active monitor type: 25 lines 
for CGA and HGC, 43 lines for EGA, and 50 lines for VGA. The maximum number 
of files which may be displayed for each monitor type is shown in the 
following table:

                    Screen     File      Max
          Monitor    Lines    Lines    Files

          VGA           50       42      210
          EGA           43       35      175
          CGA/HGC       25       17       85Š
     To accept the default file shown in the square brackets, TLE147.TXT in 
the example, press ENTER. To manually enter a filename, type the name (the 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 101


filetype .TXT will be appended if no filetype is typed) and press ENTER. To 
select one of the displayed files, use the ARROW KEYS (UP, DOWN, LEFT, 
RIGHT), Home, End, PgUp, or PgDn to move through the list until the desired 
file is highlighted and shown in the square brackets, then press ENTER. To 
cancel the function and return to the Main Menu, press ESC.
     STSPLUS defaults the drive and directory to the current directory, the 
one from which STSPLUS is being executed. However, some users prefer to use 
a separate directory for 2-line elements files. To specify a different 
drive and/or directory, enter the drive (followed by a colon) and the 
desired directory (followed by a trailing backslash, "\"). The specified 
drive, directory, and filename are saved in file STSPLUS.INI and will be 
used the next time STSPLUS is executed. The following examples illustrate 
this method:

          D:\                 Use the root directory on drive D:

          \ELEMENTS\          Use the current drive and directory 
                              \ELEMENTS\

          C:\TLE\             Use drive C: and directory \TLE\

Failing to include the trailing backslash will cause STSPLUS to interpret 
what you intended as a directory to be a filename! The complete path with
filename and filetype mask may also be entered:

          C:\TLE\*.TXT        Use .TXT files on Drive C: and directory TLE

          D:\TLE\*.*          Display all files on drive D: and directory 
                              \TLE\

          F:\TLE\TLE*.TXT     Use drive F:, directory \TLE\ and all files 
                              matching "TLE*.TXT"

Although STSPLUS defaults to filetypes "*.TXT" and "*.TLE", you may use 
this command to temporarily specify a different filename and filetype mask 
if desired.
     If no files with filetype .TXT or .TLE (or files corresponding to the 
current filename and filetype mask) are found in the specified directory, 
the following error message will be displayed:

     No matching files found in specified drive/directory: E:\JUNK
     Press any key to continue ...

To specify NO filetype, enter the filename followed by a period, i.e. 
"ELEMENTS.". Any desired filetype may be used, but the program will always 
default to ".TXT" and ".TLE" each time F2 is used.
     If you include a drive (such as "D:") and/or directory (the directory 
MUST be followed by a trailing backslash, "\"), and the drive or directory 
cannot be found, the following error message will be displayed:

     Drive or path error: E:\JUNK
     Press any key to continue ...Š
     Once the file has been selected, a default satellite name will appear 
in the next prompt:
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 102



     Enter 2-Line Filename  [STS50N38.TXT]:    STS50N38.TXT
     Enter Satellite Name/#nnnnn  [STS...]:
     (Enter '*' to match any satellite name, '&' for AUTO UPDATE)

     STSPLUS will normally display the first three characters of a 
satellite name or the full NORAD number, enclosed in square brackets, as 
the default choice. If no prior satellite has been selected, the satellite 
name will default to "STS..." for space shuttle missions (provided the 
filename begins with "STS"), to "ISS..." for the International Space 
Station  (provided the filename begins with "ISS"), and to "HST..." for all 
other satellites; otherwise, it will be the first three letters or full 
five digit NORAD number of the currently selected satellite. NORAD numbers 
are always prefixed with the "#" character. If you wish to change the 
information (or if no default is shown), enter the required information 
followed by ENTER. For the satellite name, only sufficient letters to 
unambiguously identify the desired satellite, upper or lower case, are 
required. For example, "Alou" would select "Alouette 1". However, note that 
entering "MIR" could select "MIRANDA" or "MIR deb" (Mir debris) before it 
finds "MIR" depending upon the ordering of the 2-line elements within the 
file. Alternatively, you may enter the NORAD number for the desired 
satellite by entering "#" followed by the number; leading zeroes may be 
omitted.
     Once the information has been entered, STSPLUS will attempt to locate 
the data for the requested satellite. If a satellite matching the requested 
name or NORAD number is found, the data for that satellite are displayed. 
Certain non-essential data are not always included in the 2-line elements 
and may be replaced by spaces, indicated by "(n/a)".

     Press ENTER to ACCEPT this satellite, OR
     Press any other key to REJECT and continue searching:Š

     (*) This line is normally blank. However, one of the following 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 103


     messages will appear here if a checksum error is detected in the 
     element set:

          BAD CHECKSUM in line 1 ignored!
          BAD CHECKSUM in line 2 ignored!
          BAD CHECKSUM in both lines ignored!

     In all three cases, STSPLUS will accept the data and attempt to use 
     it. Be advised, however, that the checksums are included to help 
     detect data errors that might otherwise yield an incorrect position! 
     Serious errors may even cause STSPLUS to abort with an error message.

     For convenience, the Elements Epoch (the instant at which these 
orbital elements were calculated) is shown in two formats: the first format 
is that used in the 2-line elements, YYDDD.DDDDDDDD; and the second format 
is the same time converted into conventional date and time notation. You 
may thus see immediately how old the elements are and take this into 
account when evaluating the satellite's projected position.
     If this is the satellite you wish, press ENTER and the data will be 
entered into STSPLUS. If, on the other hand, a different satellite is 
desired, press any other key (such as the SPACE BAR) and STSPLUS will 
search for another name matching the requested satellite. For example, 
there are a number of NAVSTAR Global Positioning Satellites usually 
included in the file with official names such as "GPS-0001", "GPS-0002", 
"GPS BII-01" and so forth; requesting "GPS" will allow you to cycle through 
all the available choices. The file TLEnnn.TXT is an ASCII file; it may be 
helpful to view or print the file to see the available satellite names. 
     Once the satellite has been selected, STSPLUS will require a brief 
time to calculate certain required orbital parameters, then will proceed 
directly to the display of the ground track. However, if the current 
calculated altitude of the satellite is less than 75 nautical miles, the 
satellite has probably decayed. STSPLUS will display the following message 
before returning to the Main Menu:

         Satellite MIR DEB (#22209) indicates a current altitude less than
         75 nautical miles and has probably decayed. STSORBIT PLUS can NOT
         process the orbital data for this satellite!

         Use Function Key F2 from the Main Menu to select another
         satellite and verify the satellite NAME and NORAD NUMBER.

F3     Data Output and Pass Prediction Selections
-------------------------------------------------

     By popular request, STSPLUS has been enhanced to send selected data 
for the current satellite to other equipment via a serial port (COM1 or 
COM2), to a file (STSPLUS.LOG), or to the printer (LPT1). Validation of the 
serial port output has been accomplished using two computers and a "Null 
Modem" cable. Three classes of data may be selected for output: current 
position data in three formats, precision Earth-centered inertial ("ECI") 
state vectors in four formats, and tabular Line-of-Sight pass predictions
(which are also displayed on the screen). 
     The precision state vector outputs have been carefully coordinated 
with Ken Ernandes so that they may be used as input to his program VEC2TLE, 
Version 9331 or later. Using these state vectors and VEC2TLE, the user may 
generate 2-line elements at any desired time (including just after the 
ascending node) for use with STSPLUS or other satellite tracking programs. 
With these programs, the user has a very powerful set of tools which can 
be used for a variety of analytical and display purposes. Cross validation 
of the two programs during Space Shuttle missions STS-56 and STS-55, as 
well as comparison with US Space Command data of comparable epoch, 
demonstrated high accuracy and excellent correlation.
     Each Data Output function is assigned a "Data Mode" number:

           1 = Azimuth, Elevation, Range
           2 = Latitude, Longitude, Orbit Altitude
           3 = Right Ascension, Declination
           4 = Ascending Node Data with State Vector
           5 = Precision X-Y-Z State Vector (2-Line Data)
           6 = Precision X-Y-Z State Vector (Comma Delimited)
           7 = Precision X-Y-X State Vector (Labeled Data)
           8 = Doppler Shift Frequency Predictions
           9 = Tabular Line-of-Sight Predictions

The current position data and precision state vectors are generated while 
the ground track map is displayed; for all Data Modes EXCEPT #4, data 
output may be logged continuously, for a specified time (UTC/GMT or local 
time), or for a specified time span (UTC/GMT or local time). Data Mode 4 
records data ONLY at the Ascending Node, e.g. when the Northbound equator 
crossing is detected. The predicted pass data is calculated "off-line" 
using UTC/GMT or local time, and is displayed on the screen as well as 
being sent to the selected output destination.

     Current position data include the UTC date/time and are generated for 
local horizon coordinates (altitude and azimuth), geographic coordinates 
(geocentric latitude, longitude, and orbital altitude), and topocentric 
equatorial coordinates (right ascension and declination calculated for the 
user's location). Precision X-Y-Z Earth-centered inertial state vectors 
(ECI position and velocity components) are generated as two numeric data 
lines, single line comma delimited, and multi-line labeled data. The 
details for each data output format are given in following sections.
     The precision ECI X-Y-Z state vectors, generated by STSPLUS for the 
true equator and equinox of date, have been extensively tested and Švalidated in conjunction with Ken Ernandes' program VEC2TLE during Space 
Shuttle missions STS-56 and STS-55 in early 1993. For example, the 
combination of the two programs, STSPLUS and VEC2TLE, may be used to 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 105


convert data between 2-line and ECI formats with very high accuracy. State 
vectors from STSPLUS may be read by VEC2TLE and converted into 2-line 
elements, then in turn read again by STSPLUS with essentially exact 
conversions. VEC2TLE has also been used during STS-56 and STS-55 to convert 
real time state vectors ("M50" or Mean of 1950) supplied courtesy Willie 
Musty of Mission Support, Rockwell International, into 2-line elements 
equal in accuracy to those generated by US Space Command (and made 
available four to eight hours sooner!). See the separate text section 
describing VEC2TLE.
     Note that the timing accuracy for Data Mode 4 is a fixed at 0.01 
seconds, regardless of the time step (X1, X10, or X60) then in effect. 
STSPLUS detects the Ascending Node data when the latitude switches from 
negative to positive on the Northbound crossing of the Equator. An 
iterative process is then used to refine the time to the nearest 0.01 
seconds and the data at that time are recorded.
     Potential applications for the position data include automatic antenna 
pointing systems, off-line high precision plotting, and widespread 
distribution of the data within a large facility or via modem. ECI state 
vectors may be used in real time to create 2-line elements for a specified 
epoch to full precision. Users who develop applications to utilize these 
data are invited to contribute their programs and documentation for general 
use. Since these are new features for STSPLUS, comments and suggestions are 
welcome.

     Although STSPLUS retains the capability of performing off-line pass 
predictions with Dr. TS Kelso's TRAKSTAR or other satellite tracking 
software, many users have requested that a similar feature be incorporated 
directly into STSPLUS. Pass predictions may only be calculated for 
satellites having a mean motion greater than 1.5; this eliminates 
satellites in near geosynchronous or higher orbits, but since such 
satellites don't move much that does not represent a significant 
constraint. The satellite's orbit is examined for 48 hours, starting at the 
current real or simulated time, with a sampling interval which ranges from 
10 to 60 seconds depending upon the orbit. Because of this "granularity" in 
the search algorithm, it is possible to skip passes whose duration is less 
than the sampling interval. Since those brief passes would barely peek 
above the user's horizon, they are thus not significant. Pass predictions 
may be continued in 48 hour segments until 99 passes have been displayed, 
at which point the assigned pass number is reset for subsequent pass 
predictions. Since a typical satellite may have from about two to seven 
passes in a 24 hour period, the passes may be examined for a considerable 
time into the future.
     Predicted pass data are calculated using the current satellite for 
all passes, Line-of-Sight visibility without regard to visibility, and 
visible passes. Note that visible passes normally occur near local sunrise 
or sunset. Since STSPLUS users are about equally divided between those who 
track satellites visually and those who use electronic equipment such as 
amateur radio, the three pass prediction options provide data for all 
users. Dates and times may be displayed in Coordinated Universal Time 
(UTC/GMT), local time, or Mission Elapsed Time (MET). Note that the date 
(mission day in the case of MET) for each pass is given only for AOS 
(Acquisition of Signal); it is possible for the pass to span 00:00:00 hours Š(midnight) for the time scale in use with a consequent date change during 
the pass for MAX VISIBILITY and/or LOS (Loss of Signal).
     Prediction calculations may require some time; calculation delays are 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 106


noted with the message "calculating ...". Using a processor equipped with a 
math coprocessor chip, each 48 hour block may require from less than 10 
seconds to a minute or more. However, users without math coprocessor chips 
will experience significant delays -- minutes or even tens of minutes! The 
following table lists typical calculation times for various processors (all 
with math coprocessors!) using the Russian MIR Space Station:

     The data output feature MUST be enabled with F3 each time STSPLUS is 
run; it is NOT automatically restarted when the "/R" (RESUME) command line 
option is used.

     Users are reminded that when data output is sent to the file 
     STSPLUS.LOG, a considerable volume of data may be accumulated 
     over long periods of time. It is possible to completely fill a 
     disk with this data! The file should be periodically copied to 
     other media, edited, or deleted to avoid this problem.


Setting Up Position and State Vector Data Output
------------------------------------------------

     Data output of position and state vectors ONLY occurs while the 
ground track is displayed; no data are generated until the ground track is 
actually in progress! The appropriate data are sent to the destination 
device at the selected data interval (continuous), at a specified time, or 
at the selected data interval over a specified time span covering no more 
than 24 hours.

                         ************************

     STSPLUS generates Earth-Centered Inertial ("ECI") state vectors 
     for the true equator and equinox of date. Other software and 
     various agencies may use different coordinate systems. In 
     particular, NASA uses the mean equator and equinox of the 
     Besselian year 1950 ("Mean of 1950", "M50" or "B1950"). 
     Astronomers and other agencies may use the mean equator and 
     equinox of the Julian year 2000 ("Mean of 2000" or "J2000"). 
     Other agencies, such as the DOD C-Band Radar Network, use a time-
     independent coordinate system ("Earth-fixed Greenwich" or "EFG") 
     for predicted state vectors prior to a launch. Users must take Š     care that the appropriate coordinate system is used for each 
     application and/or perform the required conversions.

     STSPLUS sets up certain initial default parameters for data output and 
displays the current parameters each time F3 is pressed, as shown in the 
following example:

         STSORBIT PLUS Data Output Parameters:

         Data Output:                  STSPLUS.LOG

         Data Format:                  7 = Precision X-Y-Z State Vector
         Data Interval:                60 seconds (continuous)
         Data Units:                   Kilometers, Multi-Line Labeled
         Accept Parameters [Y,n,x]:

For Data Mode 9, the final prompt includes the option to display the data 
on the screen only:

         Accept Parameters [Y,n,s,x]:

     To cancel data output and return to the Main Menu, press "X". If the 
current parameters are correct, press "Y" (or ENTER) to accept them. If the 
parameters are to be changed or if a specified time or time span is 
desired, press "N" to be prompted for new parameters. In each case, the 
default value which will be used if ENTER is pressed will be shown in 
square brackets; if more than one choice is shown, separated by commas, the 
first choice will be used if ENTER is pressed. The user must first select 
the data output device or destination by pressing the indicated key:

         Select Output [F,p,1,2]:
           F = File STSPLUS.LOG
           P = Printer LPT1:
           1 = Serial Port COM1:
           2 = Serial Port COM2:

Pressing ENTER or the letter "F" (upper or lower case) will select the FILE 
output and the data will be sent to the file STSPLUS.LOG. If the file does 
not exist, it will be created; if the file already exists, the data will be 
appended to the existing data. Press the letter "P" to direct the data to 
the printer on LPT1. Press "1" or "2" to direct the data to one of the two 
serial ports.
     When a serial port (COM1: or COM2:) is selected, the user next selects 
the data rate to be used for communications with the external equipment. 
Only the four data rates shown below the prompt are supported. Use the 
first character of the desired rate to select it, or press ENTER to use the 
data rate shown in the square brackets:

         Select DATA RATE [9600]:
         (300, 1200, 2400, 9600)

STSPLUS automatically sets the communications parameters to "8,N,1"; these 
are fixed and may not be altered. These communications parameters select 8 
data bits per transmitted byte, NO parity, and 1 stop bit. Most external Šequipment will operate satisfactorily with these parameters. 
     STSPLUS requires several additional items of information before it can 
send data to the external equipment, file or printer. The first is the data 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 108


format to be used. Eight different data formats are available. The next 
prompt lists the formats and shows the current default in square brackets:

         Select Data to Output [7]:
           1 = Azimuth, Elevation, Range
           2 = Latitude, Longitude, Orbit Altitude
           3 = Right Ascension, Declination
           4 = Ascending Node X-Y-Z State Vector
           5 = Precision X-Y-Z State Vector (2-Line Data)
           6 = Precision X-Y-Z State Vector (Comma Delimited)
           7 = Precision X-Y-X State Vector (Labeled Data)
           8 = Doppler Shift Frequency Predictions
           9 = Tabular Line-of-Sight Predictions

Press the number key corresponding to the desired Data Mode or press ENTER 
to select the choice shown in square brackets. See the Data Mode Formats in 
the following sections for specific details on the data included in each 
data mode.
     For current position and state vector formats except Data Mode 4, the 
desired time interval between successive sets of data must be also 
selected. (Data Mode 4 records data immediately after the Ascending Node 
and does not use the time interval parameter.) Any interval between 1 and 
900 seconds may be selected (that is, up to 15 minutes maximum). Add the 
letter "T" or "t" if you wish the data to be logged for a specific time or 
time span. Note also that this is the DESIRED time interval; if your 
computer is too slow to complete its calculations in that time, the 
interval will be longer. In other words, STSPLUS will generate the 
requested data no more frequently than the interval requested but may take 
longer, depending upon what has to be done each time. In response to the 
prompt, press ENTER to accept the default value shown in square brackets or 
type the desired numerical value (in seconds) followed by ENTER:

         Data Interval (secs) [60]:
           (Min = 1 sec, Max = 900 secs; Add 'T' for timer)

If a value less than 1 second is entered, 1 second will be substituted; if 
a value greater than 900 seconds is entered, 900 will be substituted. If 
"T" is entered by itself, the default value shown in square brackets will 
be used for the Data Interval.
     If "T" is appended to the desired interval or is entered by itself, 
STSPLUS requests the Start Time for logging:

         Start Time (HH:MM:SS):
           (Add 'U' or 'G' for UTC/GMT)

Enter the desired LOCAL Start Time or add the letter "U" or "G" for UTC/GMT 
time. STSPLUS will reformat the entered time and add the appropriate time 
zone designation, then prompt for the Stop Time:

         Start Time (HH:MM:SS):        08:45:00 PDT
         Stop Time (HH:MM:SS):
           (Press ENTER for Stop Time = Start Time)Š
Enter the desired Stop Time using the SAME time scale used for Start Time, 
or press ENTER to use the Start Time. STSPLUS will reformat the entered 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 109


time and add the appropriate time zone designation.

         Stop Time (HH:MM:SS):         08:50:00 PDT

When Start Time equals Stop Time, only one set of data will be recorded. 
Reasonable care is required when setting up these times. If the current 
time (real or simulated) is past the Start Time, data will be recorded 
immediately. Times may be set to less than 24 hours into the future.
     When state vectors are requested (Data Modes 5 through 7), STSPLUS 
must also know the desired units of measure, kilometers ("km" or "KM"), 
feet ("ft" or "FT"), or nautical miles ("nm" or "NM"):

         Data Units [KM,ft,nm]:
           (Press 1st letter to select)

Press the first letter of the desired units of measure or press ENTER for 
the current default units of measure (shown in capital letters in the 
prompt, "KM" in the example above).
     STSPLUS now displays the new parameters for approval:

         STSORBIT PLUS Data Output Parameters:

         Data Output:                  STSPLUS.LOG

         Data Interval:                60 seconds, 08:45:00-08:50:00 PDT
         Data Units:                   Kilometers, Multi-Line Labeled
         Accept Parameters [Y,n,x]:

If no Start and Stop Times have been entered, "(continuous)" will appear in 
place of the Start and Stop Times.
     As before, press "Y" (or ENTER) to accept the parameters and enable 
data output, "N" to re-enter the parameters, or "X" to cancel data output 
and return to the Main Menu.


Setting Up Tabular Pass Predictions
-----------------------------------

     STSPLUS provides two Data Modes, 8 and 9, to generate tabular pass 
prediction data. These two Data Modes may also be used simply to display 
passes of interest (with the generated data not used or discarded).

     8 = Doppler Shift Frequency Predictions
     ---------------------------------------

          Data Mode 8, Doppler Shift Frequency Predictions, displays 
     upcoming satellite passes over the user's primary location for 48-hour 
     periods. When a pass is selected and displayed, the map is drawn with 
     simulated time set to just before the beginning of the pass. As the 
     pass proceeds, the Doppler Shift information is calculated and sent to 
     the selected output device.Š
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 110


     9 = Tabular Visible and Line-of-Sight Predictions
     -------------------------------------------------

          Data Mode 9, Tabular Visible and Line-of-Sight Predictions, 
     displays (and optionally sends to an output device) data for upcoming 
     satellite passes over the user's primary location during 48-hour 
     periods. The user may select a particular pass and cause simulated 
     time to be set to the middle of the pass. The map is drawn and the 
     user may view the pass to determine any additional information of 
     interest.

The appropriate data are displayed and sent to the destination device at 
the selected data interval (continuous), at a specified time, or over a 
specified time span covering no more than 24 hours. The user may simply 
view the tabular pass information or he may select a specific pass to view 
on the map.
     Data Mode 8, the Doppler Shift Frequency Predictions, can be 
particularly helpful in preparing for a satellite amateur radio contact by 
printing the resulting frequency predictions for use during the contact. In 
this data mode, the tabular data are generated as a selected pass is 
displayed; the data include date and time, satellite geodetic coordinates 
(latitude and longitude), horizon coordinates (elevation and azimuth), and 
the frequency differences from the specified uplink and downlink center 
frequencies. See the format description for Data Mode 8 below for 
additional details. The pass selection list is NOT sent to the output 
device in this Data Mode.
     STSPLUS sets up certain initial default parameters for tabular pass 
predictions and displays the current parameters each time F3 is pressed, as 
shown in the following example:

         STSORBIT PLUS Data Output Parameters:

         Data Output:                  STSPLUS.LOG

         Data Format:                  9 = Tabular Line-of-Sight Predictions
                                           (Using PDT for times)

         Accept Parameters [Y,n,s,x]:

     To cancel data output and return to the Main Menu, press "X". If the 
current parameters are correct, press "Y" (or ENTER) to accept them or 
press "S" if output to the screen only is desired. If the parameters are to 
be changed or if a specified time is desired, press "N" to be prompted for 
new parameters. In each case, the default value which will be used if ENTER 
is pressed will be shown in square brackets; if more than one choice is 
shown, separated by commas, the first choice will be used if ENTER is 
pressed. The user must first select the data output device or destination 
by pressing the indicated key:

         Select Output [F,p,1,2]:
           F = File STSPLUS.LOG
           P = Printer LPT1:Š           1 = Serial Port COM1:
           2 = Serial Port COM2:

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 111


Pressing ENTER or the letter "F" (upper or lower case) will select the FILE 
output and the data will be sent to the file STSPLUS.LOG. If the file does 
not exist, it will be created; if the file already exists, the data will be 
appended to the existing data. Press the letter "P" to direct the data to 
the printer on LPT1. Press "1" or "2" to direct the data to one of the two 
serial ports.
     When a serial port (COM1: or COM2:) is selected, the user next selects 
the data rate to be used for communications with the external equipment. 
Only the four data rates shown below the prompt are supported. Use the 
first character of the desired rate to select it, or press ENTER to use the 
data rate shown in the square brackets:

         Select DATA RATE [9600]:
         (300, 1200, 2400, 9600)

STSPLUS automatically sets the communications parameters to "8,N,1"; these 
are fixed and may not be altered. These communications parameters select 8 
data bits per transmitted byte, NO parity, and 1 stop bit. Most external 
equipment will operate satisfactorily with these parameters. 
     STSPLUS requires several additional items of information before it can 
send data to the external equipment, file or printer. The first is the data 
format to be used. Five different data formats are available. The next 
prompt lists the formats and shows the current default in square brackets:

         Select Data to Output [7]:
           1 = Azimuth, Elevation, Range
           2 = Latitude, Longitude, Orbit Altitude
           3 = Right Ascension, Declination
           4 = Ascending Node X-Y-Z State Vector
           5 = Precision X-Y-Z State Vector (2-Line Data)
           6 = Precision X-Y-Z State Vector (Comma Delimited)
           7 = Precision X-Y-X State Vector (Labeled Data)
           8 = Doppler Shift Frequency Predictions
           9 = Tabular Line-of-Sight Predictions

Press the "8" or "9" number key to select one of the pass predictions or 
press ENTER to select the choice shown in square brackets. See the Data 
Mode Formats in the following sections for specific details on the data 
included in each data mode.
     For tabular pass predictions, STSPLUS must know the time zone for 
which data is to be displayed. The choices are UTC/GMT, the LOCAL time 
zone, or Mission Elasped Time (MET):

         Use UTC, PDT, MET [PDT]:
           (Use LEFT LETTER or '*'=MET to select)

Depending upon the user's choice when the UTCOffset was set, either "UTC" 
or "GMT" will be displayed along with the abbreviation for the local time 
zone. Use the left-most letter of the desired time zone, press "*" for 
Mission Elapsed Time (MET), or press ENTER to accept the time zone shown in 
the square brackets ("[PDT]" in the example).
     For tabular pass predictions, STSPLUS requests several additional Šitems of information. First, the type of pass prediction is selected:

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 112


         Select Pass Type [LoS]:
         (Enter A=All, L=Line-of-Sight, V=Visible)

Press the indicated letter (upper or lower case) to select the desired pass 
type or press ENTER to select the choice shown in square brackets. For 
Line-of-Sight and Visible passes, STSPLUS also requests the minimum 
altidude which the pass must attain and the minimum horizon threshold:

         Minimum Altitude [5]:
         Minimum Horizon [3]:

In each case, enter the desired angle (in degrees) or press ENTER to select 
the choice shown in square brackets. Minimum Altitude may be set to any 
desired value from 3 to 45 degrees. Minimum Horizon must be set to a 
smaller angle than Minimum Altitude.
     STSPLUS now returns to the initial parameter display and again asks if 
the parameters are correct. As before, press "Y" to proceed with pass 
predictions AND sending the data to the specified destination device, "N" 
to change parameters, "S" (pass predictions ONLY) to display the pass 
predictions on the screen WITHOUT sending the data to a destination device, 
or "X" return to the Main Menu and cancel the data output.
     For both pass prediction modes, the data are displayed on the screen 
as calculated and optionally (for Pass Predictions ONLY) sent to the 
selected destination device. The following is a sample of the output data 
(the screen display is similar) for Space Shuttle Mission STS-69 in 
September of 1995:

     Location            Current primary location
     Prepared            Computer date and time of preparation
     Satellite Name      Satellite common name or mission name
     Catalog Number      NORAD Number and International Designation
     TLE Filename        2-Line file used for data calculations

The column headings indicate the data displayed. "AOS" is Acquisition of 
Signal or when the satellite rises above the user's true horizon. "MAX 
VISIBILITY" is the maximum altitude above the user's true horizon that the 
satellite reaches during the pass. "LOS" is Loss of Signal or when the 
satellite sets below the user's true horizon. "#" is an arbitrary pass 
number for this set of calculations. The format for the data sent to the 
destination device is slightly different from that displayed; see the Data 
Mode 9 format description below.
     For Pass Predictions, the user may select either UTC/GMT or LOCAL date 
and times for pass predictions. If other than UTC is selected, substitute 
the appropriate time zone abbreviation as required. The date is given as dd 
MMM yy (where: "dd" is the day of the month, "MMM" is the alphabetic 
abbreviation for the month, and "yy" is the last two digits of the year) 
and only for AOS; since passes may span 00:00:00 hours for the selected 
time zone, the actual date for MAX VISIBILITY and/or LOS may have to be 
incremented.
     Times are calculated to the nearest second, altitudes are rounded to 
the nearest degree, and azimuths are rounded to the nearest tenth of a 
degree. Azimuth is always calculated in the sense NESW where North = 0 
degrees, East = 90 degrees, etc. Note that the degree symbol will appear on 
the display for all "Azm" and "Alt" data but has been deleted in the sample 
above in order to maintain compatibility with various printers; the actual 
display is thus four columns wider than the example above.
     STSPLUS uses color to enhance the Pass Prediction display and make 
visible passes more obvious to the user. Users with a monochrome monitor 
may have to examine candidate passes using the map display to obtain the 
same information. The orbit of the primary satellite is first examined for 
line-of-sight passes (as in previous versions). For each pass which rises 
above the horizon of the user's location, four times are calculated: "AOS", 
the Acquisition of Signal; "MAX", the time of maximum satellite altitude; 
"LOS", the Loss of Signal; and "Duration", the total duration of the pass Šfrom AOS to LOS. Each pass is then examined for lighting conditions at AOS, 
MAX, and LOS. If the satellite is in full or partial sunlight and the 
user's location is in darkness, and the satellite is at least five degrees 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 114


above the true horizon, the pass is a VISIBLE PASS and the satellite may be 
visible to the naked eye or binoculars if the satellite is sufficiently 
large and other geometric conditions (along with the weather) are suitable; 
these visibility conditions are indicated by the color of the information:

                    NOT VISIBLE         VISIBLE
          -------------------------------------------------------------
          AOS       Bright Green        White

          MAX       Bright Cyan         Bright White (Altitude >=5 deg)
                    Cyan                White        (Altitude < 5 deg)

          LOS       Bright Red          White

     These visibility conditions may appear in a number of combinations. A 
satellite may be visible at AOS (or LOS) but not at MAX, the satellite may 
not rise five or more degrees above the user's horizon yet still be 
technically visible under essentially perfect conditions, and so forth. 
Further, since the visibility conditions are only tested at three points in 
the pass, it is possible that certain very low altitude visible passes may 
not be marked with the appropriate "VISIBLE" color; it is unlikely that 
these passes would actually be visible in any event. To aid the user (and 
particularly the user with a monochrome display), passes which are visible 
at MAX are marked with "*" at the far right in the column labeled "V".

     Several types of visible pass conditions are illustrated by the sample 
data for the Russian Mir Space Station, reproduced above. In this example, 
all three test points (AOS, MAX, and LOS) are indicated in White for Pass 1 
and Pass 8; however, since both are very low passes (2 and 3 degrees, 
respectively), no special flag is shown at the right and it would be 
unlikely that the pass could actually be seen. Pass 9 shows both AOS and ŠMAX in White but again it is a low pass so no flag is shown at the right. 
Pass 10 shows AOS in White but MAX in Bright Cyan and includes the "*" 
special flat at the right; this pass happens to have a 12 degree MAX 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 115


altitude but the satellite disappears into the Earth's shadow approximately 
80 seconds (at an altitude of approximately 8 degrees) after it breaks the 
horizon and might be visible under good conditions. The sample was 
deliberately chosen to illustrate the difficulties involved. Ideally, a 
"good" visible pass will be shown in Bright White at AOS, have a MAX 
altitude of 25 or more degrees, and will be indicated by the special "*" 
flag at the right. Clear skies are assumed for all viewing conditions.
     Satellite viewers are reminded that satellite size and shape as well 
as the physical geometry of the situation can affect visibility. For 
example, a large satellite positioned between the viewer and the Sun may 
reflect little or no sunlight towards the viewer and thus not be visible. 
Conversely, a small satellite with a highly reflective surface (such as a 
solar panel) which happens to be ideally positioned at a given instant, may 
produce a brilliant flash on a particular night but nothing the next night. 
Other satellites (and especially debris objects such as rocket bodies) may 
be rotating or tumbling and appear to flash from time to time. The specific 
circumstances which make one satellite visible and another not are too 
complex for exact analytical solution given the data available. The best 
that can be done is to estimate when the circumstances are such that naked 
eye visibility is of relatively high probability for larger, low Earth 
orbit satellites. MIR, GRO, HST, and the Space Shuttle are ideal targets.
     When Launch Simulation is enabled (a launch time and date plus launch 
pad selection has been made using F5 from the Main Menu), STSPLUS adjusts 
the start time for prediction calculations to MET = 0/00:40:00 or forty 
minutes after launch (by which time the orbiter will have reached the 
expected orbit). Pass predictions are not available during the ascent phase 
of a launch. The start time used is also converted to conventional date and 
time and an additional message will appear above the data for Pass 1 on 
both the screen and the selected device output:

   (Start time adjusted to MET = 0/00:40:00 or 08 JUN 1995 @ 15:00:00 UTC)

Therefore, the user may view pass predictions for an upcoming launch 
without cycling through days or weeks of meaningless data. Note, however, 
that if a launch pad selection has NOT been made, STSPLUS will use the 
estimated 2-line elements to calculate prediction data.

     Press ENTER while the passes are being calculated to stop the 
calculations. When all calculations for the current 48 hour block have been 
completed, the time elapsed for the calculations is displayed and the user 
is asked if another set of calculations is desired or if a particular pass 
should be displayed. Press "N" or ENTER to return to the Main Menu, or 
press "Y" to perform the next 48 hour block of calculations. The 
calculations will be stopped when 99 passes have been listed. Typically, 
from four to sixteen passes are listed for each 48 hour block, the number 
being related to the characteristics of the current satellite's orbit. If 
additional passes beyond that time are desired, set simulated time (F8+F3 
from the Main Menu) to the desired start time and repeat the predictions.
     To display a particular pass, enter the listed pass number (the number 
in the far left column marked "#"). Passes are assigned arbitrary numbers 
from 1 to 99 beginning with the first pass which occurs during or 
subsequent to the current real or simulated time. Any pass number may be Šselected, from pass #1 to the last listed pass shown on the screen. 
(Attempting to enter a pass number larger than the last one shown will 
cause the computer to "beep" and the prompt will be repeated.) STSPLUS will 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 116


set simulated time to approximately 30 seconds prior to the mid-point of 
the selected pass and prepare the display. The pass may then be examined 
for details of lighting, ground track, and so forth. STSPLUS displays "VIS" 
next to the orbit inclination if a visual sighting may be possible. While 
examining the pass, use F6 to PAUSE the display, then use the "+" or "-" 
keys to adjust the simulated time forward or backward. The default time 
step is one second; press F4 to select a different time step: 1, 10, or 60 
seconds. Press ENTER to return to normal operation from the PAUSE mode.
     For Doppler Shift Frequency Predictions only, the displayed pass 
begins just before AOS (Acquisition of Signal) instead of near the maximum 
elevation. Doppler shift frequency data will be sent to the output device 
only after AOS is reached and until LOS (Loss of Signal) is reached. The 
user may use "fast time" to speed up the operation but there may be some 
loss of accuracy. Press ENTER once the pass has been completed to return to 
the Main Menu.
     Each time predicted passes are requested, the list begins with the 
first pass which occurs at or subsequent to the current real or simulated 
time. Note that STSPLUS automatically sets simulated time to display a 
predicted pass, and that new simulated time remains in effect until the 
user returns to the Main Menu, at which point the time is restored to the 
real or simulated time in effect BEFORE the pass prediction was displayed. 
Repeated use of pass predictions will therefore generally produce the same 
list of passes; however, if sufficient time elapses between predictions 
that a pass "comes and goes", new pass numbers will be displayed.

NOTES:

1.   The X-Y-Z Cartesian State Vector is given as a standard Earth-centered 
     inertial ("ECI") cartesian 6-dimensional state vector where the X-Axis 
     is pointing toward the vernal equinox, the Z-Axis is pointing toward 
     the North Pole, and the Y-Axis is mutually orthogonal to the other 
     axes in a right-handed axis system. All coordinates are for true 
     equator and equinox of date.

2.   The units of measure for the state vector may be determined by the 
     tens digit of the Data Mode in the initial header line as well as 
     being indicated with the data:

      4   Kilometers and kilometers per second
     14   Feet and feet per second
     24   Nautical miles and nautical miles per second

3.   One data item is given per line, labeled as shown in the examples. The 
     data in the first four lines (Satellite Name, Catalog Number, and two 
     lines of Date/Time) begin in column 25. The remaining numeric data 
     items begin in column 21 and use a FORTRAN-like format statement 
     F21.11.

4.   The Catalog Number is given first as the NORAD Number ("16609" in the 
     example) and then as the International Designation ("86017A"). The 
     "launch piece" of the International Designation is from 1 to 3 
     letters. Some 2-line elements omit the International Designation, in 
     which case that portion will be blank.

5.   Note that the Date/Time is presented on two lines in two different 
     formats. The first format is the NASA Day-of-Year ("DOY") format, 
     YYDDD.DDDDDD, since that is the format used by NASA/JSC for X-Y-Z 
     state vectors for the Space Shuttle, in 2-line elements, and in 
     program VEC2TLE. In the DOY format, time is counted from midnight 
     (00:00 UTC) each day. Some calculations may require instead the Julian 
     Date format which counts time from noon (12:00 UTC) each day. The 
     Date/Time is also "decoded" and given in the more conventional 
     "MM/DD/YYYY  HH/MM/SS.SSS" format for clarity using Coordinated 
     Universal Time (UTC/GMT).

6.   The ElSet Number is specified in the 2-line elements used to generate 
     the ground track and is always given as an integer. Note that ElSet 
     Numbers may not necessarily follow in sequence and that different 
     sources will use different sequences of ElSet numbers.Š
7.   The Rev Number at Epoch (the orbit number at the time the data is 
     sampled) is based upon the Rev Number specified in the 2-line elements 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 122


     used to generate the ground track. The fractional part is calculated 
     by STSPLUS geometrically from the ascending node. Note that US Space 
     Command uses a different orbit numbering convention than does NASA for 
     space shuttle missions; US Space Command usually specifies the first 
     (partial) orbit number as Rev 0, while NASA specifies that orbit 
     number as Rev 1. For satellites which have been in orbit for long 
     periods of time, the Rev Number may be arbitrary.

1.   The X-Y-Z Cartesian State Vector is given as a standard Earth-centered 
     inertial ("ECI") cartesian 6-dimensional state vector where the X-Axis 
     is pointing toward the vernal equinox, the Z-Axis is pointing toward 
     the North Pole, and the Y-Axis is mutually orthogonal to the other 
     axes in a right-handed axis system. All coordinates are for true 
     equator and equinox of date.

2.   The units of measure for the state vector may be determined by the 
     tens digit of the Data Mode in the initial header line:

      5   Kilometers and kilometers per second
     15   Feet and feet per second
     25   Nautical miles and nautical miles per second

3.   The NASA Day-of-Year format is used here for date and time since that 
     is the format used by JSC for X-Y-Z state vectors and also in 2-line 
     elements. In the DOY format, time is counted from midnight (00:00 UTC) 
     each day. Some calculations may require instead the Julian Date format 
     which counts time from noon (12:00 UTC) each day.

NOTES:

1.   The X-Y-Z Cartesian State Vector is given as a standard Earth-centered 
     inertial ("ECI") cartesian 6-dimensional state vector where the X-Axis 
     is pointing toward the vernal equinox, the Z-Axis is pointing toward 
     the North Pole, and the Y-Axis is mutually orthogonal to the other 
     axes in a right-handed axis system. All coordinates are for true 
     equator and equinox of date.

2.   The units of measure for the state vector may be determined by the 
     tens digit of the Data Mode in the initial header line as well as 
     being indicated with the data:

      7   Kilometers and kilometers per second
     17   Feet and feet per second
     27   Nautical miles and nautical miles per second

3.   One data item is given per line, labeled as shown in the examples. The 
     data in the first four lines (Satellite Name, Catalog Number, and two 
     lines of Date/Time) begin in column 25. The remaining numeric data 
     items begin in column 21 and use a FORTRAN-like format statement 
     F21.11.

4.   The Catalog Number is given first as the NORAD Number ("16609" in the 
     example) and then as the International Designation ("86017A"). The 
     "launch piece" portion of the International Designation is from 1 to 3 
     letters. Some 2-line elements omit the International Designation, in 
     which case that portion will be blank.

5.   Note that the Date/Time is presented on two lines in two different 
     formats. The first format is the NASA Day-of-Year ("DOY") format, 
     YYDDD.DDDDDD, since that is the format used by NASA/JSC for X-Y-Z 
     state vectors for the Space Shuttle, in 2-line elements, and in 
     program VEC2TLE. In the DOY format, time is counted from midnight 
     (00:00 UTC) each day. Some calculations may require instead the Julian 
     Date format which counts time from noon (12:00 UTC) each day. The 
     Date/Time is also "decoded" and given in the more conventional 
     "MM/DD/YYYY  HH/MM/SS.SSS" format for clarity using Coordinated 
     Universal Time (UTC/GMT).

6.   The ElSet Number is specified in the 2-line elements used to generate 
     the ground track and is always given as an integer. Note that ElSet 
     Numbers may not necessarily follow in sequence and that different 
     sources will use different sequences of ElSet numbers.

7.   The Rev Number at Epoch (the orbit number at the time the data is Š     sampled) is based upon the Rev Number specified in the 2-line elements 
     used to generate the ground track. The fractional part is calculated

     Command uses a different orbit numbering convention than does NASA for 
     space shuttle missions; US Space Command usually specifies the first 
     (partial) orbit number as Rev 0, while NASA specifies that orbit 
     number as Rev 1. For satellites which have been in orbit for long 
     periods of time, the Rev Number may be arbitrary.

NOTES:

1.   The header information gives the satellite name and catalog number, 
     the Epoch Date/Time of the TLEs, and the center frequencies for the 
     Uplink and the Downlink (usually in units of MHz) as read from file 
     STSPLUS.FRQ (if present) or the default value of 100 MHz.

2.   One data line is generated for each time step. For the date, only the 
     month and day ("MM/DD") are given in order to accommodate line length 
     restrictions. The time is given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

3.   The satellite geodetic coordinates, latitude and longitude, are given 
     in degrees. Negative latitude is South, negative longitude is West.

4.   The satellite horizon coordinates, elevation and azimuth, are given in 
     degrees and the sense is NESW, North = 0, East = 90, etc.

5.   The doppler shift calculations are shown as the frequency difference 
     (in Hz) from the corresponding center frequency (in MHz, shown in the 
     header) at the selected intervals throughout the pass.

NOTES:

1.   When the Data Output mode is set up for pass predictions, dates and 
     times for pass predictions may be selected for UTC/GMT or local time 
     and the selected time zone abbreviation and time scale will be used. 
     Substitute the appropriate abbreviation for "UTC" as required if other 
     than UTC has been selected. When UTC or GMT is selected, the Data Mode 
     will be given as "9"; when local time is selected, the Data Mode will 
     be given as "19".

2.   The Pass # is an arbitrary number assigned by STSPLUS during the pass 
     calculations and is a function of the real or simulated time at which 
     the calculations are performed. If the real or simulated time is 
     changed, the pass numbers may change and different passes may be 
     shown.

3.   The satellite NORAD number is included in the heading, "16609" in the 
     sample above.

4.   The Date (UTC/GMT or local) or Mission Day (MET) is given only for 
     AOS. Since a pass may span 00:00:00 hours, the date or mission day for 
     MAX VISIBILITY and/or LOS may have to be incremented from that shown 
     for AOS.

5.   All azimuths ("Azm") have been rounded to the nearest 0.1 degree; the 
     MAX VISIBILITY altitude ("Alt") has been rounded to the nearest 
     degree.

6.   When viewed on the screen, all Azimuths and the Altitude will include 
     the degree symbol and the data is four columns wider than the sample 
     shown above.

7.   The Visible Pass Flag will be blank if the pass is not visible or will 
     display "*" if all or part of the pass is visible. A visible pass is 
     defined as a pass which occurs with the satellite in sunlight, the 
     viewing location in darkness, and the satellite elevation above the 
     true horizon greater than 5 degrees. These conditions typically occur 
     prior to sunrise and subsequent to sunset (although exceptions are 
     possible with higher inclination satellites during certain times of 
     the year).

8.   The initial header information does not appear on the screen version 
     of the pass predictions; instead, a single header line gives the pass 
     type and criteria. The location is the current primary location; the 
     preparation date and time shown is that for which the computer is set 
     when the data are generated; the catalog number is the NORAD Number 
     followed by the International Designation.

F4     Calculate Satellite Positions with TRAKSTAR
--------------------------------------------------

     Tabular predictions for the currently selected satellite may be made 
by using TRAKSTAR by Dr. TS Kelso. STSPLUS has been arranged to operate 
seamlessly with TRAKSTAR by simply pressing Function Key F4 from the Main 
Menu. Note that sufficient RAM (Random Access Memory) must be available to 
execute TRAKSTAR or the program will fail to operate with only the briefest 
of error messages (which may not be visible at all on fast processors!). 
All data required by TRAKSTAR is automatically supplied by STSPLUS. See the 
section above "Predicting Satellite Passes with TRAKSTAR" and the TRAKSTAR 
documentation for full information.


F5     Set Launch Time and Date
-------------------------------

     Orbital data for the satellite must be loaded using the F2 command on 
the Main Menu before the launch date and time may be set or changed. Once 
saved in file STSPLUS.LTD, the launch date and time will be automatically 
read from that file each time the satellite is selected (see below).

     INFORMATION IS NOT INCLUDED IN 2-LINE ELEMENTS.

     Launch date and time are most important for manned missions such as 
the Space Shuttle since the mission timeline is reckoned using Mission 
Elapsed Time. However, MET may be used whenever actual launch date and time 
are known. The only requirement is that 2-line orbital elements must be 
available for the satellite. Since launch date and time are NOT included in 
the 2-line orbital elements, this means that you obtain the launch date and 
launch time independently and manually enter that data.
     Pressing F5 to enter launch date and time begins with the prompt:

                   Current time:  19:01:32 PDT   02:01:32 UTC
                   Current date:   15 APR 1995    16 APR 1995




     Enter LAUNCH TIME (HH:MM:SS)    [06:37:00 UTC]:Š       [Add 'U'or 'G' for UTC/GMT]

Enter the time in the format shown using 24-hour notation. Add the letter 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 136


"U" to signify UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or the letter "G" to 
signify GMT (Greenwich Mean Time, essentially identical to UTC for the 
purposes of this program). Use no suffix for local time; it will be 
internally converted to UTC/GMT. If you enter "U" or "G", the abbreviation 
used in the menus will be set to "UTC" or "GMT" respectively. One or two 
digit numbers may be used as required. [The comma is also acceptable as a 
separator in place of the colon.] You may omit seconds [or minutes and 
seconds] if desired. For example, an entry of "16" will be entered as 
16:00:00 or 4:00 PM. Press ENTER to leave the entry unchanged.

     Enter LAUNCH DATE (MM/DD/YYYY)   [02 MAR 1995]:
       [Enter '*' to clear LAUNCH DATE]

Enter the date in the format shown (US style) or "DD.MM.YYYY" (European 
style); in either format, the year may be shortened to the last two digits, 
"1995" may be entered as "95". Note that if you requested UTC or GMT when 
entering the time, the date is interpreted as the UTC/GMT date. The full 
four digit year may be used OR two digits as in "92". Be sure to use the 
SLASH "/" rather than the MINUS "-" as the separator; STSPLUS's internal 
date algorithms will interpret the minus sign as just that and some rather 
strange dates can result! You may also use relative dates: -1 will use the 
prior day, +2 will use two days hence, and so forth. Press ENTER to leave 
the date unchanged. Press "*" (followed by ENTER) to clear the launch date 
and time; this does NOT remove it from file STSPLUS.LTD.

     Select LAUNCH SITE (0=Disabled)  [1]:
     [Enter '1' for Pad 39A, Cape Canaveral, FL]
     [Enter '2' for Pad 39B, Cape Canaveral, FL]

If the current mission is a Space Shuttle launch, you may optionally cause 
STSPLUS to generate Launch Simulation. Launch Simulation displays the 
orbiter on the selected Launch Pad up to the time of launch, then simulates 
the ascent trajectory for the first 40 minutes of the mission (after which 
time STSPLUS uses the estimated pre-launch 2-line elements for orbital 
calculations. Launch Simulation is enabled by selecting as a LAUNCH SITE 
either Pad 39A or Pad 39B at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Press "1" or "2" 
respectively to select the LAUNCH SITE desired, or press "0" to disable 
Launch Simulation. The current default choice is shown in square brackets 
in the prompt ("[1]" in the example above); press ENTER to select the 
current default.

     NOTE: STSPLUS can only simulate the launch of the Space Shuttle from 
     Cape Canaveral, Florida. Attempting to enable launch simulation for 
     other satellites or missions may produce unpredictable results. Launch 
     Simulation REQUIRES valid pre-launch 2-line elements for the specified 
     launch time and date. If a launch is delayed, new estimated pre-launch 
     2-line elements must be prepared for the new launch time and date. For 
     most missions (not including rendezvous missions), my program ADJ2LINE 
     may be used to calculate new estimated 2-line elements when a delay is 
     encountered.

     When all data have been entered, the program displays the launch data Šas entered and pauses for your approval. If all data are correct, press 
ENTER. Press the SPACE BAR to start over.

You are next asked if you wish to save this data:

     Add/Update this data in file STSPLUS.LTD [Y,n]:

Press "Y", "y" or ENTER to add or update the data in file STSPLUS.LTD (see 
below). Press "N" or "n" to use the data but not add or update it in file 
STSPLUS.LTD. Adding or updating the data to file STSPLUS.LTD makes sure 
that the launch date and time data will be available the next time this 
particular satellite is selected.


Using File STSPLUS.LTD for Launch Date & Time
---------------------------------------------

     An alternative and automatic method to set launch date and time is to 
use file STSPLUS.LTD. This file contains the NORAD number and launch date 
and time (UTC Julian date) for selected satellites. A sample entry appears 
as:

     22194,2448918.21503472,0
     --+-- -------+-------- +
       |          |         |
       |          |         +--- Launch Site for Space Shuttle launches
       |          |                0 = Launch Simulation DISABLED
       |          |                1 = Pad 39A, Cape Canaveral, FL
       |          |                2 = Pad 39B, Cape Canaveral, FL
       |          |
       |          +------------- Launch Date (UTC Julian date)
       |
       +------------------------ NORAD Number

The Sample above shows the data for Space Shuttle mission STS-52 (NORAD 
#22194) and corresponds to a launch date and time of 22 OCT 1992 @ 17:09:39 ŠUTC. The file is in standard ASCII format and may be edited with any 
standard editor; word processor users use the "non-document" mode. Use care 
when manually editing the file as STSPLUS performs NO ERROR CHECKING!
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 138


     For Space Shuttle launches, Launch Simulation may be enabled by 
specifying the Launch Site as noted above. Only Space Shuttle launches may 
use Launch Simulation and estimated pre-launch 2-line elements for the 
specified launch time and date are REQUIRED. Attempting to use Launch 
Simulation without accurate estimated pre-launch 2-line elements OR with 
other satellites or missions may cause unpredictable results.
     Estimated 2-line orbital elements are usually available prior to a 
Space Shuttle launch, and actual 2-line orbital elements within about 8 to 
12 hours after a launch. Note, however, that the NORAD number is not 
assigned until actual launch and a "dummy" NORAD number is used for 
estimated pre-launch elements; for example, "99967" for STS-67. Once the 
launch has taken place, the permanent NORAD number is assigned. This change 
in NORAD number will require either that file STSPLUS.LTD be edited OR that 
a new entry be made. Note that there are still a few satellites around with 
low NORAD numbers!
     
     If file STSPLUS.LTD is present and if the selected satellite is found, 
the launch time and date will be set and Mission Elapsed Time (MET) will be 
used automatically; otherwise, T+Epoch (T+E) will be used. When MET is 
displayed, it may be changed to T+E by pressing F5 while the map is 
displayed.
     File STSPLUS.LTD is read each time a new satellite is selected using 
F2 from the Main Menu. If file STSPLUS.LTD is NOT present, the launch date 
and time will be saved in file STSPLUS.INI and must be MANUALLY MAINTAINED 
as in versions prior to 9245! If you wish to use the old method, rename or 
delete file STSPLUS.LTD.


F6     Set/Read/Save TDRS and Real Time Satellites
--------------------------------------------------

     STSPLUS is able to display up to 48 additional TDRS (or other 
geosynchronous/geostationary) or Real Time satellites. The first menu 
selection allows the user to select the desired satellite for each of the 
sixteen available "slots" as well as abbreviation, mode, and icon/label 
color. Note that these features are enabled and disabled using F10+F3+F2 
from the Main Menu. The following menu is displayed:

         Press function key for desired choice or ENTER for Main Menu:

The name of the current Satellite Configuration File (SCF) is shown. Press ŠENTER to return to the Main Menu, or press the desired function key to 
select the indicated function.
     Before the current position of each satellite can be calculated, 2-

line elements must be read or updated using F2 from the Main Menu. After 
this has been performed once, the position will be calculated based upon 
those 2-line elements. The user is reminded that the 2-line elements should 
be updated periodically so that the calculated position accurately reflects 
the actual position.

NOTE:     Users of prior versions of STSPLUS will note that Function Key F6 
          has been reassigned for its present function. Switching between 
          MET and T+Epoch may now be accomplished ONLY by pressing F5 while 
          the ground track is displayed.

NOTE:     The first two satellite slots, #1 and #2, are reserved for 
          geosynchronous communications satellites. These are usually the        
          standard TDRS East and TDRS West satellites, currently NORAD         
          Numbers 19833 and 21639. Instead of conventional circles of 
          visibility, these two satellites generate communications coverage 
          circles. Assigning satellites which are not geosynchronous may 
          produce unpredictable results.

The Satellite Setup table headings indicate:
Š     Sat#      Satellite Assignment Number, 1 to 48. If an asterisk ("*") 
               appears to the right of the number, the epoch (date) of the 
               associated orbital elements is more than 10 days (Real Time) 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 140


               or 60 days (Static) old as in this example:

               and the following caution note will appear at the bottom of 
               the display:

               *  2-Line Elements more than 10 (Real Time) or 60 (Static) 
                  days old!

               The caution note has no effect on orbital calculations and 
               is simply a reminder that the orbital elements may be out of 
               date and may or may not be valid. Use F2 from the Main Menu 
               with "&" as the satellite name to update TLEs from a current 
               data file.

     NORAD#    The NORAD Number of the assigned satellite, or "0" if no 
               satellite is assigned to this slot.

     Abbr      The five character abbreviation assigned to this satellite. 
               Use only letters and numbers; the common satellite name or 
               NORAD Number are the recommended choices. This abbreviation 
               will be used as a label on the map if the Label is ON. May 
               be left blank.

     Mode      Five mode classifications are available: 

                    Primary        Primary satellite selected for full 
                                   tracking, selected using F2 or F6+F4 
                                   (below). The primary satellite may not 
                                   be present in the satellite list.

                    Static         Geosynchronous or geostationary 
                                   satellites (including TDRS). Plotted 
                                   when map is drawn and NOT updated.

     Color     A number selected from the Color Chart at the right which 
               indicates the color to be used to display the satellite icon 
               and label (if enabled). Each "XXXXX" in the Color Chart 
               appears on color monitors as a bar of the corresponding 
               color. The "o" character to the right of the number is 
               displayed as a small diamond in the selected color.Š
     Size      For Static satellites only, selects the relative size of the 
               icon used to represent the satellite. Values may range from 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 141


               3 to 6. This column is blank for Real Time satellites since 
               the icon size is fixed for these satellites.

     Label     May be set to "ON" or "OFF" to indicate if the satellite 
               abbreviation is to be displayed. The label color will be the 
               same as that selected for the satellite.

     Vis       May be set to "ON" or "OFF" to indicate if the satellite 
               circle of visibility is to be drawn. The circle of 
               visibility is drawn only for Static satellites on normal 
               maps but is drawn for all satellites on Motion maps.

     Color     The color chart displays the 15 available icon and label 
     Chart     colors (BLACK is omitted). When a monochrone display is used 
               and the "/M" command line option is specified, two levels of 
               gray will normally be displayed instead of colors. Each 
               color is assigned a standard color number which is used for 
               all data entries.

     As indicated by the prompt, simply press ENTER if all data in the 
Satellite Setup is correct. You will return to the F6 menu above. If you 
wish to add a satellite or change the selections for an existing satellite, 
enter the satellite slot number (Sat# in the left column of the table). The 
data for the selected slot will flash in white and the following prompts 
will be displayed in turn:

          Enter NORAD Number:
          (Enter 0 to clear the satellite entry)

STSPLUS expects the NORAD number for the desired satellite. This number 
will be used to "capture" the 2-line elements when this satellite is 
subsequently displayed.

          Enter Satellite Abbreviation:

Enter any desired abbreviation, 5 characters or less, or the NORAD number. 
Use only letters, numbers, and the period ("."), dash ("-"), and comma 
(",") with no leading spaces. The Satellite Abbreviation is used as the 
satellite label on the map display (see below) and may be left blank if 
no label is desired.

          Enter Mode (0=STATIC, 1=REAL TIME, 2=OFF):

Enter "0", "1", or "2". STATIC satellites are plotted each time the map is 
redrawn on the screen. REAL TIME satellites are updated every 1 or 10 
seconds (depending upon the processor/coprocessor present) or as often as 
the processor can complete the required calculations. Satellites set to OFF 
are not processed but their data is retained so that they may be returned 
to STATIC or REAL TIME subsequently.

          Enter satellite color (1 to 15):
ŠEnter the number for the desired color, as shown on the Color Chart at the 
right of the screen. An illegal color number will default to YELLOW.

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 142


          Display satellite Label (0=NO, 1=YES):

Enter "0" or "1". The label will be displayed directly below the satellite 
icon in the same color as that selected for the icon in the preceding step. 
For Real Time satellites, the label is only drawn when the map is redrawn 
and remains stationary EXCEPT when using the Motion Map (in which case it 
follows with the icon).

          Display Cir of Visibility (0=NO, 1=YES):

Enter "0" or "1". The circle of visibility is drawn (when enabled) for all 
Static satellites, and also for all Real Time satellites when using the 
Motion Map.
     When a new satellite is entered, a double asterisk ("**") will appear 
at the right for that satellite slot. This is to remind the user to update 
the 2-line elements or to display the ground track for that satellite so 
that 2-line elements may be stored in the TLE memory associated with that 
slot. Failure to update the TLEs may cause a program error! The following 
message will also appear below the chart:

     **  Update TLEs (F2+'&') or display ground track for this satellite!

When STSPLUS adds a new Secondary Satellite, a skeletal and INVALID 2-line 
element set (TLE) is saved which includes only the NORAD number so as to 
identify the satellite. Before the satellite can be tracked, real TLEs must 
be present; the skeletal TLEs will be skipped. This may be accomplished by 
updating the TLEs using F2 from the Main Menu and selecting AUTO UPDATE 
(satellite name entered is "&"). Alternatively, the satellite ground track 
may be displayed; to display the ground track, press F2 from the Main Menu, 
select the file of 2-line elements which includes the satellite in 
question, and enter the NORAD Number ("#nnnnn", where "nnnnn" is the NORAD 
Number). In either case, the 2-line elements will be saved for future use.


                           ** IMPORTANT NOTE **

     Although 2-line elements (TLEs) are saved for all satellites, the user 
is reminded that these data have a limited lifetime. That lifetime varies 
considerably from satellite to satellite. For geosynchronous satellites, 4 
to 8 weeks is probably reasonable; for other active satellites, 1 to 2 
weeks should be an upper limit before new elements are used. TLEs for 
satellites which maneuver may become inaccurate in a matter of days. 
Allowing TLEs to become too old may yield an inaccurate position and, in 
the worst case, may cause a program error! Use F2 from the Main Menu and 
enter the satellite name as "&" to scan through the 2-line elements file 
and update all elements which are more recent than those now saved.

F2  Save SCF Satellite Configuration File
-----------------------------------------

     Users may wish to switch among several sets of TDRS and Real Time 
satellites from time to time. Since it can be tedious to re-enter all the Šinformation repeatedly, STSPLUS can save and read Satellite Configuration 
Files, identified by the filetype .SCF. All parameters are saved and 
restored, exactly as if entered at the time. The current satellite 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 143


configuration is automatically saved in file STSPLUS.INI each time the 
program is exited and is restored when the program is restarted. The 
following prompt is displayed:

          Save SCF Satellite Configuration File [STSPLUS.SCF]

          Enter SCF FILENAME, ENTER for STSPLUS.SCF, ESC to quit:

          Current .SCF files are:

          STANDARD.SCF
          STSPLUS.SCF

STSPLUS displays the name of the current SCF file and a list of available 
SCF files, up to a maximum of 90 files. Press ENTER to accept the default 
filename shown, or ESC to cancel the operation. Otherwise, type the desired 
filename with or without the .SCF filetype; STSPLUS automatically appends 
the .SCF filetype and will ignore any other filetype which is included. 
Filenames may be no longer than 8 characters.
     If the file already exists, STSPLUS will display a warning message:

          File STANDARD.SCF already exists! Overwrite [y/N]:

where "STANDARD.SCF" will be the requested file including the .SCF 
filetype. Press "Y" or "y" to allow the existing file to be overwritten; 
press any other key to cancel the write operation, and then press ENTER to 
resume program operation. If the file does not exist, it will be created. 
Do not use filename STSPLUS since a sample file by that name is included 
with the distribution package (unless you wish to overwrite the supplied 
file).

F6  Clear Static and Real Time Satellites
-----------------------------------------

     Use this function to clear selected static and/or real time 
satellites with slot numbers 3 through 48. STSPLUS asks the user to enter 
the first and last slot to clear, and to confirm the operation to avoid 
accidental clearing. 


     Clear Static and Real Time Satellites

     NOTE: Slots 1 & 2, usually assigned to TDRS East and TDRS West,
           must be cleared MANUALLY using F1.

     The last slot currently in use is 29

     Enter first slot to clear (ENTER to cancel): 26
     Enter last slot to clear (ENTER to cancel):  29

     Slots 26 through 29 will be cleared!

     Press 'Y' to clear, any other key to cancel:


     As the sample prompts above illustrate, the user must enter the first 
and the last slot to be cleared, then confirm by pressing the letter "Y" 
(upper or lower case).
     NOTE: Slots 1 and 2 are reserved for geosynchronous communications 
satellites and should ALWAYS contain TDRS or similar geosynchronous 
satellites. The program may perform unpredictably if these slots are 
cleared or use non-geosynchronous satellites.


F7     Set FILENAMES and PATHS
------------------------------

     Function Key F7 allows the user to select the paths and/or filenames 
for the various files that STSPLUS uses to select satellites, tracking 
stations, and other features:

          Select path or filename to set, press ENTER when done:

            F1  Set 2-LINE ELEMENTS path:      [I:\TLE\]
            F2  Set TRACKING STATION filename: [STSPLUS.TRK]
            F3  Set MAP DATABASE FILES path:   [D:\MAPDATA\]
            F4  Set FEATURES LABEL filename:   [STSPLUS.LOC]
            F5  Set TRAKSTAR path:             [D:\STSPLUS\]
            F6  Set CITYFILE filename:         [STSPLUS.CTY]
Š          Enter selection or ENTER:

Press the indicated function key for the item you wish to change. The 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 147


current path or filename is shown in square brackets for each selection. 
Press ENTER to leave a path or filename unchanged. The following is a 
typical prompt for filename:

          Enter TRACKING STATION filename: _
          (Press ENTER to leave unchanged)

     For filenames, enter the full filename including filetype. A drive and 
directory may also be included if desired. If no filetype is entered, 
STSPLUS will automatically supply ".TRK" for tracking station files, and 
".LOC" for features label files. If the desired file has no filetype, 
include the period in the filename entered (e.g. "STATION.") to prevent the 
automatic addition of a filetype.
     For the path selections, enter the desired drive and subdirectory. The 
trailing backslash will automatically be added if it is omitted. If the 
path cannot be found, an error message will be displayed and the path will 
default to the current drive and directory. For best performance, use a RAM 
disk for Map Database Files; see the section "Using a RAM Disk" for further 
information.
     After each entry, the Path and Filenames Menu is again displayed with 
the current selections. Press ENTER when done to return to the STSPLUS Main 
Menu.


F8     Set Program TIME and DATE
--------------------------------

     This menu provides a number of time and date functions for use 
with STSPLUS. The program clock may be set to real or simulated time 
using several methods, and the UTC OFFSET and DAYLIGHT Flag may be 
set. The user may also select either LOCAL or UTC time for his computer.
     It is often convenient to set the TIME and DATE within STSPLUS to 
something other than the current system time and date, or to return to the 
current system time and date if the program time and date have been 
changed. Press F8 to go to the TIME and DATE Menu:

         ENTER  Return to MAIN MENU

         Select desired function:


     The Date and Time Menu, shown above, displays the available time 
setting functions along with the actual system date and time as determined 
by the DOS software clock in your computer (even if simulated time is in 
effect). Both your local date and time, "PDT" or Pacific Daylight Time in 
the example, and "UTC" (Coordinated Universal Time) date and time are 
displayed. If times have been set using the letter "G", the abbreviation at 
the right will be "GMT" (Greenwich Mean Time).
     Press ENTER to return to the Main Menu with the date and time as 
displayed on the screen (Current or Simulated).
     If you wish to execute STSPLUS in "real time", canceling any simulated 
time that may be in effect, use the F1 command. This will restore the time 
and date used for the tracking display to that shown at the top of the 
menu. If the actual system date or time displayed is incorrect, use the F2 
command to correctly set your system clock.
     Some organizations, NASA for example, continue to use the wording 
"Greenwich Mean Time" or "GMT" for what is now usually referred to as 
"Coordinated Universal Time" or "UTC" (and sometimes, depending upon the 
application, as "UT", "UT1" or "UT2"). STSPLUS uses Coordinated Universal 
Time or "UTC", the time used for civil timekeeping and broadcast by radio 
stations such as WWV and the BBC. Although technically these different time 
standards are not exactly the same, the difference is only a maximum of 0.9 
seconds and the program treats them all as identical. STSPLUS defaults to 
the abbreviation "UTC" but if you prefer to use "GMT", enter any simulated 
time using F3 and include the letter "G" (upper or lower case) at the end. 
The time abbreviation at the top of the screen will change from "UTC" to 
"GMT" and will continue using that abbreviation until a time is entered 
suffixed with "U". 
     Times are always entered as "HH:MM:SS" where HH is HOURS, MM is 
MINUTES, and SS is SECONDS. The time entry format is very flexible. Leading 
zeroes are not required. The comma (",") may be used in place of the colon 
(":") as a separator if desired. SECONDS or MINUTES and SECONDS may be 
omitted if desired. Time entries are assumed to be local time; to enter UTC 
or GMT times, add the letter "U" or "G" (upper or lower case) respectively 
following the entry. For example, the following are valid time entries:

          Entry          Interpreted as
          ------         --------------------------
          12             12:00:00 (LOCAL TIME ZONE)

          1:20g          01:20:00 GMT

     Dates may be entered as "MM/DD/YYYY" or "MM/DD/YY" (US style) or as 
"DD.MM.YYYY" or "DD.MM.YY" (European style) where MM is MONTHS (as a number 
from 1 to 12), DD is DAYS, and YYYY is the full four-digit YEAR or YY is Šthe last two digits of the YEAR. Except for the two digit year option, the 
full date must always be entered; leading zeroes are not required. The 
delimiter used ("/" or ".") determines the method of interpretation:
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 149



          Entry          Interpreted as
          ---------      --------------
          12/8/94        12 AUG 1994
          12/8/1994      12 AUG 1994
          8.12.94        12 AUG 1994
          8.12.1994      12 AUG 1994

The date entered is assumed to be for the same time zone as the time 
entered. If local time is entered, the date will be treated as the local 
date; if UTC (or GMT) time is entered, the date will be treated as the 
UTC/GMT date.
     After a time or date entry has been accepted (after you press the 
ENTER key), STSPLUS reformats the entry to its standard format, clears the 
characters you entered, and replaces them by the standard format in both 
local and UTC/GMT time zones. This provides a double check that the program 
has interpreted your entry as you wished.

F1     Restore System Date and Time
-----------------------------------

     Press F1 to restore the program date and time to the system date and 
time. This command reads the DOS clock and restores the program to "real 
time" operation. If the program date and time have not been changed with 
the F3 or F4 commands, this command will have no effect.

F2     Set DOS System Clock
---------------------------

     Press F2 to set the DOS system clock. Use this command if you wish to 
change the actual date and time on your system. Note that on many systems 
using DOS 3.3 or higher, this command will set BOTH the software clock AND 
the hardware clock.

F10    Set UTC OFFSET, DAYLIGHT Flag, and DOS Time Zone
-------------------------------------------------------

     STSPLUS uses UTC or Coordinated Universal Time, an adjusted version 
of Universal Time (which STSPLUS considers the same as GMT or Greenwich 
Mean Time), for certain functions such as launch time. The difference 
between UT, UT1, UT2 and UTC is never more than 0.9 seconds. UTC is used 
because it is the standard for civil timekeeping and agrees with standard 
atomic time, TDB or Terrestrial Barycentric Time, used by astronomers. 
However, NASA continues to use the GMT designation, a holdover from earlier 
days before the introduction of UTC. Using UTC permits critical data to be 
used across many time zones without conversion. However, it also means that 
STSORBIT must know what number of hours to add to UTC in order to obtain 
your local time, and whether or not you are currently using daylight 
savings time (summer time in the UK).
     When prompted, enter the time offset in hours from your local time to 
Coordinated Universal Time. Examples are shown for most time zones in North 
America. STSPLUS then asks if you are using daylight savings time; enter 
"0" if not, and "1" if so. The sum of these two values is shown on the Main 
Menu; for example, if the computer is set to Pacific Daylight Time (UTC 
offset is -8.00 hours and Daylight Flag = 1), the sum will be -7.00. For 
most time zones in North America, the correct zone abbreviation will be 
shown on the ground track display for Local date and time. When you change 
your computer from/to daylight savings time, use this command to update 
STSPLUS. The following shows the display when using the F9 command:


Set UTC TIME ZONE OFFSET and DAYLIGHT FLAG

STSPLUS must know the difference between your local time zone and UniversalŠCoordinated Time (UTC), also sometimes known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
With this information, STSPLUS can automatically adjust launch times and
dates for your local time zone. In addition, STSORBIT must know if you are
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 152


now on STANDARD or DAYLIGHT (SUMMER) time and if your DOS clock is set to 
UTC.

First, enter the difference between your STANDARD time zone and UTC in hours.
Do NOT include the hour for daylight time if you are now on DAYLIGHT time;
it will be entered separately. For most time zones in the United States and
Canada, the entries required are:

  Eastern Standard Time     EST    -5.00
  Central Standard Time     CST    -6.00
  Mountain Standard Time    MST    -7.00
  Pacific Standard Time     PST    -8.00

Enter UTC Offset (hours) [ -8.00]:
Enter Daylight Flag (0=OFF, 1=ON)  [1]:
Enter DOS time zone (0=LOCAL, 1=UTC)  [0]:


Once this information has been entered, it will be saved in file 
STSPLUS.INI and will not be requested again. If you change from Standard to 
Daylight Time or vice versa, use the F10+F10 command to update the Daylight 
Flag.
     Some users prefer to operate their computer using UTC rather than 
local time. STSPLUS may be operated in either time zone mode and makes all 
necessary conversions. NOTE: Even if your DOS clock is set to UTC, the UTC 
Offset and Daylight Flag must be set correctly!
     If you change the setting of the Daylight Flag, STSPLUS will ask if 
you wish to adjust your DOS software clock:

          You have changed the setting of the Daylight Flag.

          Do you wish to adjust your DOS clock to reflect the
          change [y/N]:

If you have already made the change at the DOS prompt (or using some other 
software) or do not wish to change the DOS clock, press ENTER (or type "N" 
followed by ENTER). If you wish to adjust the DOS clock to correspond to 
the new setting of the Daylight Flag, press "Y" followed by ENTER. When 
STSPLUS changes the DOS clock, it synchronizes the time change to the 
nearest second but there may be a small error introduced; only if your 
computer is precisely set would the error be detectable.

                               *************
                               *  CAUTION  *
                               *************

For computers equipped with 80286 or higher processors AND using DOS 3.2 or 
higher, changing the DOS clock will ALSO change the hardware clock. 8088-
based computers may or may not have a hardware clock installed and, even if 
a hardware clock is present, it may or may not be compatible with the DOS 
time setting commands.

F9     DOS Shell (CAUTION: DOS 3.2 or higher ONLY!)
--------------------------------------------------

     If a system function is desired at the Main Menu, press F9 to execute 
BASIC's DOS SHELL function. This will return you to a DOS prompt and most 
DOS commands may be executed immediately. When the Shell is executed, 
STSPLUS remains in memory. All files used by STSPLUS are closed. However, 
this means that a substantial amount of memory is in use and not available 
to DOS during the shell operations. As of Version 9540, STSPLUS requires 
approximately 414KB of memory. This means that many programs will have 
insufficient memory to execute under the DOS Shell.
     Enter "EXIT" (without the quotation marks and followed by ENTER) at 
the DOS prompt when you wish to return to STSORBIT. 

     CAUTION: The BASIC SHELL function is only reliable for versions of DOS 
     of 3.2 or higher! Systems with less than 640K memory may fail to 
     execute the shell and applications requiring large amounts of memory 
     may also fail.

     CAUTION: The BASIC SHELL function does NOT perform reliably when 
     STSPLUS is executed under Windows and a BASIC ERROR or other 
     unpredictable results may follow! Instead, close STSPLUS and use the 
     MS-DOS PROMPT function from the FILE MANAGER.


F10    Set STSORBIT PLUS Program Options and Features
-----------------------------------------------------

     A number of program features and display options are set using the F10 
Program Options Menu. These selections are further described in the section 
"Program Options Menu" below.

ALT-F1 Display Satellite Orbital Data
-------------------------------------

     Pressing ALT-F1 enables the display of orbital data for the Primary 
Satellite and all Secondary Satellites.

     NOTE: File STSAUX.EXE must be present in the STSPLUS directory and 
     have the same Version Number as STSPLUS for this feature to be active. 
     If file STSAUX.EXE is not present, no action or error results. STSAUX 
     can only be executed from within STSPLUS; attempting to execute the 
     program separately will generate an error message.

Because of memory limitations inherent in DOS coupled with the continuing 
growth of STSPLUS, the orbital data display feature is included in a 
separate EXE file. Pressing ALT-F1 terminates the main STSPLUS program and 
invokes this separate program. Most users will notice only a slight delay 
and operation is completely transparent. The following menu is displayed to 
allow the user to select the satellite for which orbital data is to be 
displayed:

     Since the satellite in the example above is in a geosynchronous orbit, 
defined for this display as one whose Mean Motion is in the range 0.9 to 
1.1 revolutions per day, an additional data item, "Last Geosync Position", 
is displayed. This is the position (longitude, positive is EAST and 
Negative is WEST) last calculated by STSPLUS when the tracking map was 
displayed. "Geosynchronous orbit" describes an orbit which is nearly but 
not necessarily exactly positioned over a particular point over the equator 
or "synchronous" with the Earth's rotation. Some apparent motion in 
latitude is allowed with that definition; "geostationary orbit" describes 
an orbit with little or no apparent motion in either latitude or longitude.
     Over time, satellite operators have discovered that keeping a 
satellite in true geostationary orbit is very costly in propellant. 
Allowing a satellite to drift slightly with time, especially in latitude, 
can substantially increase the effective life of the satellite while still 
keeping the satellite "in the box" or within its assigned orbital slot. 
Users will notice a small change in the listed position over time and from 
one set of TLEs to another. Satellites which are being moved from one slot 
to another will exhibit a Mean Motion significantly larger or smaller than 
1.00 revolutions per day.Š     The "Inclination" is a measure of how much drift in latitude will 
occur; the closer the inclination is to zero, the less the drift in 
latitude. The "Mean Motion" is a measure of how much change in longitude will 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 156


occur; the closer the Mean Motion is to one, the more nearly stationary in 
longitude will be the orbit. The "Eccentricity" is a measure of how close 
to a true circle is the orbit; the closer the eccentricity is to zero, the 
more circular the orbit. The remaining parameters provide the balance of 
the data required to characterize the orbit.
     For non-geosynchronous orbits, the last position data is omitted since 
it may change rapidly (and this is a static display except for the time 
information). The orbital data itself again characterizes the satellite's 
orbit. The "Inclination" indicates how many degrees the orbit is tilted to 
the plane of the Earth's equator; an inclination of more than 90 degrees is 
termed a "retrograde orbit". The "Mean Motion" describes the number of 
revolutions about the Earth the satellite makes in one day; for example, a 
typical space shuttle in low Earth orbit ("LEO") will have a mean motion of 
from 15.0 to 16.0, which corresponds to an orbital period of about 90 
minutes.


ALT-F2 Run Program GPSSYNC
--------------------------

     Program GPSSYNC is a separate program designed to interoperate with 
STSPLUS to provide time and date synchronization of the computer clock to 
an accuracy of approximately one second and to determine the current 
position (latitude, longitude, and elevation). GPSSYNC may also be operated 
independently of STSPLUS. The program may be downloaded from my home page.
     To execute GPSSYNC, press ALT-F2 from the STSPLUS Main Menu. STSPLUS 
checks to see if file GPSSYNC.EXE is present in the STSPLUS directory. If 
not, the BELL sounds and STSPLUS returns to the Main Menu. If GPSSYNC.EXE 
is present, operation switches to that program. As of the current release 
of GPSSYNC, Version 9838, GPS operations have been tested with DeLorme and 
Garmin GPS receivers. Other receivers may or may not be recognized or 
interoperate correctly. Upon exit from GPSSYNC (Version 9837 or later), 
execution returns to the STSPLUS Main Menu. For details on the use and 
operation of GPSSYNC, please see the documentation supplied with the 
program.

F1     Enable/Disable LAN Operations
------------------------------------

     When operated with certain add-on software or in conjunction with a 
peer-to-peer Local Area Network (LAN), some of STSPLUS' functions may be 
controlled independently. In particular, when STSPLUS is used for public 
display, it is usually not desireable to halt operation of the program for 
updates to orbital data (TLEs); operation with Greg Swift's program 
STSUPDAT allows these updates to occur transparently to the viewer. New 
TLEs may be updated automatically with a single keypress (F11) via the 
Internet. STSPLUS detects the new data, reads and processes the data, then 
simply redraws the screen with the new data in effect.
     Note, however, that enabling LAN operations requires regular disk 
accesses by STSPLUS to check for updates from STSUPDAT. For 16-bit users of 
DOS or Windows 3.11 or in cases where STSUPDAT is not in use, it is 
recommended that they be set to OFF to avoid these disk accesses.
     Detailed instructions on the use of LAN operations and program ŠSTSUPDAT are provided with program STSUPDAT (available separately).

F2     Set New Local Coordinates
--------------------------------

     In order to perform the calculations related to satellite visibility 
and altitude/azimuth, STSPLUS must know the geographic (geodetic) 
coordinates for the user's location. The names of the current PRIMARY and 
SECONDARY (if present) locations are shown. When STSPLUS is first started, 
the default coordinates for the PRIMARY location are set to Palos Verdes, 
California, near Los Angeles, and the SECONDARY location is disabled. The 
current PRIMARY location is indicated by the name in parentheses on the 
Options Menu. The program provides two methods for setting your own 
coordinates: reading a file of city or place names and coordinates 
(STSPLUS.CTY is the default filename); or manually entering the 
information.
     Pressing F2 at the Main Menu will display the Local Coordinates Menu:

     Current PRIMARY Location:      Palos Verdes, CA
                                    Latitude:     33.7632 degrees
                                    Longitude:  -118.4057 degrees
                                    Elevation:   186      meters
     Current active CITYFILE:       STSPLUS.CTY

        F1  Search CITYFILE for PRIMARY location
        F2  Search CITYFILE for SECONDARY location
        F3  Enter coordinates for PRIMARY location
        F4  Enter coordinates for SECONDARY location

        F6  Select TRACKING STN for PRIMARY location

     ENTER  Return to Program Options & Features Menu

     Enter desired selection:

Or, if a SECONDARY location is currently enabled, the following Local 
Coordinates Menu will be displayed:

     Current PRIMARY Location:      Palos Verdes, CA
                                    Latitude:     33.7632 degrees

Š        F6  Select TRACKING STN for PRIMARY location

     ENTER  Return to Program Options & Features Menu
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 160



     Enter desired selection:

Press the indicated function key to perform the desired function, or press 
ENTER to return to the Program Options & Features Menu. The F5 selection 
will only appear if a SECONDARY Location is currently enabled. NOTE: To 
change the current active CITYFILE, use F7 from the Main Menu.

     NOTE: If the current active CITYFILE is not the one you wish to use, 
     press ENTER twice to return to the Main Menu and then use F7 to set a 
     new CITYFILE path and/or name.


F1/F2 Search CITYFILE for Location
----------------------------------

     Pressing F1 or F2 will search the current CITYFILE for the full or 
partial name (the "CITYNAME") you enter. The following prompt appears:

     Enter partial NAME to match:

In other words, when you enter a name or partial name, STSPLUS will attempt 
to match that group of characters anywhere in the names which appear in the 
current city file. For example, 'SAN' matches 'SAN diego' as well as 'SANta 
ana" and 'thouSANd oaks'. To get 'SAN FRANCISCO' on the first try, enter 
'SAN F' with a space between the 'N' and 'F'. Case is not significant; 
upper and lower case letters are treated identically. If you change your 
mind and wish to cancel the operation, simply press ENTER by itself. Use 
BACKSPACE to make corrections.
     To begin the search, enter the desired name after the prompt. In the 
example which follows, F2 was pressed and the name 'santa' was entered for 
the search:

     Processing record  1616

       Location:   Santa Ana, CA
       Latitude:     33.7633
       Longitude:  -117.8650
       Elevation:    20 meters

     Press ENTER to ACCEPT this city as your SECONDARY location, OR
     Press ESC to cancel, SPACE to search for next location:

     If the city displayed is the one you wish to use as your PRIMARY or 
SECONDARY location (depending upon which function key you selected, F1 or 
F2), press ENTER. The information will be used by STSPLUS and subsequently 
saved in file STSPLUS.INI. If you wish to search further in the file, press 
the SPACE BAR. If you wish to cancel the search, press ESC to return to the 
Local Coordinates Menu.

     NOTE: Some of the elevations contained in file STSPLUS.CTY are zero 
     because the elevation (in meters) above mean sea level was unknown Š     when the file entry was prepared. If you know the correct elevation 
     for your location, edit the file using any ASCII text editor and 
     change the last number on the line. STSPLUS.CTY contains over 2000 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 161


     cities. If users send me their correct elevations (or additional 
     cities they wish added), I will incorporate that data into subsequent 
     releases of file STSPLUS.CTY.


F3/F4 Enter New Coordinates for Location
----------------------------------------

     To enter location data manually, press F3 (for the PRIMARY location) 
or F2 (for the SECONDARY location). You will be prompted for the city name, 
latitude, longitude, and elevation. Latitude and longitude may be entered 
using three different formats for convenience (note the use of comma and 
decimal point):

          DDD.DDDDD           Degrees and decimal fraction
          DD,MM.MMM           Degrees, minutes and decimal fraction
          DD,MM,SS.SS         Degrees, minutes, seconds and fraction

The decimal point and decimal fraction are not required in any of the 
formats. For example, to enter 33 degrees and 17 minutes, type "33,17". 
Note that SOUTH latitude must be entered as a NEGATIVE number as measured 
south of the Equator. Longitudes may be entered as EAST Longitude, the 
number of degrees East of the Prime Meridian at Greenwich (0 to 360 
degrees) OR as WEST longitude( 0 to -180 degrees), the NEGATIVE number of 
degrees West of the Prime Meridian at Greenwich; regardless of the manner 
entered, the longitude will be automatically converted to the range of -180 
degrees through 180 degrees. The default unit for elevations is meters 
above mean sea level; add "F" (upper or lower case without the quotation 
marks) if you wish to use feet.
     After the elevation has been entered, the data will be displayed for 
approval. All data are converted to degrees and decimal fraction or integer 
meters as appropriate, regardless of the format or units used on input.

       City Name:  Rancho Palos Verdes CA
       Latitude:     33.7675
       Longitude:  -118.4033
       Elevation:   186 meters

     Press ENTER to ACCEPT this city as your PRIMARY location, OR
     Press ESC or SPACE to cancel this data:

If you are entering data for the secondary location, the word "SECONDARY" 
will appear instead of "PRIMARY" in the prompt. Press ENTER to accept the 
data as shown or press ESC or the SPACE BAR to cancel the data and return 
to the Local Coordinates Menu. If the data is accepted, STSPLUS will ask if 
you wish to append (add) this city/location to the current city file 
(normally STSPLUS.CTY) so that it will be automatically available thereafter.

     Do you with to append this data to file STSPLUS.CTY (Y/n):  _

Press "Y" or ENTER to append the data to the current city file shown in the 
prompt, OR press "N" to use the data but not modify the current city file.Š

F5 Clear (disable) Secondary Location
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 162


-------------------------------------

     If a SECONDARY Location is displayed on the Local Coordinates Menu and 
you wish to cancel (disable) that feature, press F5. If the secondary 
location is already disabled, the F5 menu item will not be displayed.


F6 Select TRACKING STN for PRIMARY Location
-------------------------------------------

     You may select one of the Tracking Stations included in the current 
Tracking Station file (default is file STSPLUS.TRK) as the Primary Location 
by pressing F6. The screen will display the first tracking station in the 
file:

     Select TRACKING STATION:

     Station Name:    Maui, Hawaii
       Abbreviation:  HAW
       Latitude:       20.9
       Longitude:     -156.7
       Elevation:      396

     Press ENTER to ACCEPT as Primary Location, or
     press SPACE to view next Tracking Station:

To select the displayed tracking station, press ENTER. To skip to the next 
tracking station entry in the file, press the SPACE BAR.

F3     Set Display Features
---------------------------

     A number of display features may be enabled or disabled using a 
separate sub-menu. See the section SET DISPLAY FEATURES below for a full 
description.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 163


F4     Enable/Disable PCX Image File Generation
-----------------------------------------------

     The F4 command may be used to enable or disable automatic PCX Image 
File Generation. The resulting PCX image file may be used for illustration 
of current or predicted events, printing, or conversion to other graphics 
formats such as GIF. This feature is only available with EGA and VGA 
display adapters. Two methods are available to generate the PCX image file:

     MANUAL: While the map is displayed, pressing "*" will cause the 
     current map to be immediately written. This method is available 
     whether or not automatic PCX file generation is enabled.

     AUTOMATIC: The PCX image file may also be written by timed execution 
     at intervals of approximately 1 to 99 minutes. To enable or disable 
     timed execution of PCX Image File Generation, press F10 at the Main 
     Menu then press F4 to set up PCX Image File Generation.

F4 selects the PCX Image File Generation Setup. STSPLUS displays a series 
of prompts to allow the user to set up the various modes and features of 
PCX image file generation:

                       PCX Image File Generation Setup

     STANDARD 'STSPLUS.PCX' or NUMBERED 'STSnnn.PCX' Filename [S,n]:

Press "S" or ENTER to select the standard PCX filename of STSPLUS.PCX. 
Press "N" for sequentially numbered files with the form STSnnn.PCX where 
"nnn" is replaced by a number from "001" to "999". (The filename will cycle 
back to "001" after "999".) If NUMBERED files are selected, enter the 
desired starting file number from "1" to "999" or press ENTER for the next 
file number shown in square brackets:

     Enter starting STSnnn.PCX file number [002]:

The next filename will be displayed, such as "STS002.PCX" for the default 
response above.
     The next prompt allows the user to select MANUAL or AUTOMATIC PCX 
Image File Generation. Note that MANUAL is the default and is always 
available:

     Use MANUAL or AUTOMATIC PCX Image File Generation [M,a]:

Press "M" or ENTER for MANUAL, "A" for AUTOMATIC. If AUTOMATIC is selected, 
the user will be prompted for the desired interval between image files in 
minutes:

     Enter desired Image File Generation Interval (1-99 minutes):    

Enter the desired number of minutes. This is the final setup prompt. The 
user may then press ENTER to accept the selections shown or press ESC to 
repeat the selection process:Š
     Press ENTER to ACCEPT, ESC to REPEAT selections:

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 164


     When AUTOMATIC PCX Image File Generation has been selected, the first 
PCX file will be generated as soon as the tracking map as been completed on 
the screen. The interval to the next file generation will be started as of 
that moment. Timing accuracy of file generation is within several seconds 
of the selected interval. To synchronize subsequent file generation with 
the clock, press the "*" key at the desired time. The name of the current 
PCX file is displayed at the lower right of the screen (VGA orthographic 
projection) or upper right of the screen (all other maps).

     NOTE: When AUTOMATIC Image File Generation is enabled, STSPLUS redraws 
the tracking map approximately 20 seconds prior to the time the image file 
is to be written. This allows sufficient time for the map to be redrawn in 
time for image file generation for all but the slowest processors. In this 
mode, the primary satellite is centered in the tracking map rather than 
offset to one side; the image file will therefore show the primary 
satellite near the center of the tracking map at all but the highest zoom 
factors.
     Note also that AUTOMATIC PCX Image File Generation will substantially 
increase disk activity on the system. The user is responsible for ensuring 
that sufficient disk space is available for the PCX Image Files; 
insufficient disk space will cause STSPLUS to halt with an error message. 
Using numbered PCX files, up to 60MB can be required for 999 PCX files if 
they are not periodically purged!

     PCX Image File Generation may be used with either rectangular or 
orthographic map projection. The PCX image files use RLE (Run Length 
Encoding) to compress the image. For VGA images, the image file size ranges 
from approximately 50KB to 60KB; EGA images are somewhat smaller. For 
unnumbered files, the PCX file is always named STSPLUS.PCX and will be 
overwritten at each file generation. For numbered files, any existing file 
with the same number will be overwritten. The PCX Image File Generation 
flag is saved in file STSPLUS.INI and will remain in effect until changed.
     For users who prefer images in the GIF format, a 1989 shareware 
program called CVT2GIF (Version 1.5, author unknown) has been included in 
the distribution package. This small program converts the PCX image to a 
GIF image. To perform the conversion, exit STSPLUS and enter the following 
command at the DOS prompt:

          CVT2GIF STSPLUS.PCX

The resulting STSPLUS.GIF image is suitable for use on the Internet in WWW 
home pages. For numbered PCX files, substitute the appropriate filename. 
The typical file size of the GIF image is 25KB to 30KB.

     NOTE: PCX files written in EGA mode (either with the /EGA command line 
option, the Motion Map enabled, or for systems equipped with an EGA display 
adapter) may not display with the correct aspect ratio on systems with a 
VGA display adapter; the vertical dimension may appear "squeezed". The EGA 
uses the same 640 horizontal pixels but only 350 vertical pixels instead of 
480 pixels for the VGA.

F5     Show Ascending & Descending Node Data
--------------------------------------------

     The nodes of an Earth orbit are the points on the ground track where 
the path crosses the Equator. The Ascending Node crosses from South to 
North and the Descending Node crosses from North to South. Orbit numbers 
normally increment at the Ascending Node. This command adds two additional 
lines of data at the lower left of the screen giving the time (MET or Time 
since Epoch, depending upon which is enabled) and longitude of the most 
recent ascending and descending nodes. The data fields are blank until the 
first node of each type has actually been crossed; the data fields will be 
updated on each subsequent node crossing. This information may be useful 
when comparing STSPLUS's data against other sources such as the wall map in 
Mission Control.
     The following illustrates a typical display for the Mir Space Station 
with MET (Mission Elapsed Time) enabled:

          Asc Node: 56772  -86.09  3627/07:57:20
          Dsc Node: 56772   82.17  3627/08:43:30
          ----+---- --+-- ---+---  ------+------
              |       |      |           |
              |       |      |           +-------- Node Time (MET or T+E)
              |       |      |
              |       |      +-------------------- Longitude of Node
              |       |
              |       +--------------------------- Orbit Number at Node
              |
              +----------------------------------- Node Name

Note that only the five least significant digits of the Orbit Number at 
Node are shown. The display also includes the degree symbol to the right of 
the Longitude at Node.
     This feature is also automatically enabled while Printer Logging of 
the node data, F10+F10 from the Main Menu or F3 while the map is displayed.

F6     Set Map Projection and Size
----------------------------------

     The F6 command selects the size and field of view of the displayed 
map. By default, the map is displayed using the orthographic projection, 
"ORTHO", shows one complete hemisphere, and is centered so that the 
selected satellite is visible. This corresponds to a magnification factor 
of 100%.
     Pressing F6 will select between WORLD, QUAD, ZOOM, and ORTHO maps. 
Selecting WORLD will display the full world using rectangular projection 
centered on the Prime Meridian at Greenwich, England at 0 degrees 
longitude or at the International Date Line at 180 degrees longitude. 
Selecting QUAD will select one of twelve Quadrant Maps showing a field of 
view (horizontal size) of 180 degrees using rectangular projection. 
Selecting ZOOM will select a Zoom Map with field of view adjustable from 30 
degrees to 180 degrees; the default field of view is 75 degrees; the Zoom 
Map is approximately centered on the current ground track position of the Šsatellite. Selecting ORTHO will select the orthographic projection. See the 
sections ORTHOGRAPHIC MAPS, QUADRANT MAPS, ZOOM MAPS, and AUTOMATIC MAP 
GENERATION for additional information.

F7     Enable/Disable EVENT TIMERS
----------------------------------

     Press F7 to enable or disable all event timers. Event timers are 
enabled by default if file STSPLUS.INI is present. Especially while the map 
is being drawn, the calculations associated with the event times require 
appreciable time. If the event timers are disabled, the audible alarms will 
also be disabled. See the section "Event Timers and Audible Alarms" for a 
full discussion of the event timers.


F8     Enable/Disable Audible ALARMS
------------------------------------

     Provided event timers are enabled (above), you may press F8 to enable 
or disable audible alarms. Many users allow their computer to run STSPLUS 
while performing other tasks and the audible alarm will alert them to an 
imminent AOS (Acquisition of Signal) or LOS (Loss of Signal) event 
associated with either their local circle of visibility or the TDRS 
communications satellites.
     For the local circle of visibility, an "up/down" tone sounds six times 
two minutes prior to AOS and five tones sound thirty seconds prior to LOS. 
Provided TDRS coverage is enabled (F10+F3+F2 from the Main Menu), three 
brief tones sound thirty seconds prior to AOS or LOS. Provided Sun features 
are enabled (F10+F3+F8), two tones will sound approximately thirty seconds 
before orbital sunrise and sunset. The characteristics of the audible tones 
will thus allow the user to identify what kind of AOS or LOS event is about 
to happen.
     Depending upon the computer and the version of DOS being used, "music" 
such as these audible alarms may cause the DOS clock to lose a small amount 
of time each time an alarm sounds. The amount of time loss is quite small 
but may accumulate over long periods of time. (The DOS clock may also run 
either fast or slow and effectively mask the time loss due to sound 
effects.)


F9     Set User-Definable Map Colors
------------------------------------

     STSPLUS allows the user to set the colors for certain map features. 
These features are the Local Station circle of visibility, the concentric 
isocontours used in the Location and Tracking Modes, and the Tracking 
Station circle of visibility color. Pressing Function Key F9 displays the 
current color assignments (and a color chart on the right of the screen):

          Current User-Definable Map Colors

          ----- 13 Local Station Color
          ----- 14 Isocontour Color
          ----- 12 Tracking Station ColorŠ

          Press ENTER to ACCEPT, SPACE to CHANGE:
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 167



The "-----" in the example is a solid line illustrating the map color. The 
number to its right is the number used to represent that color. The colors 
shown in the example are the default colors. If the colors shown are 
acceptable, press ENTER. To change the color assignments, press the SPACE 
BAR and the color assignments will be prompted in turn:

          Enter color for Local Station: 5
          Enter color for Isocontours:   6
          Enter color for Tracking Stns: 4

Use the color chart at the right of the screen to select new colors and 
enter the corresponding number. Press ENTER to leave a color unchanged. As 
each color is assigned, the display sample will change accordingly. When 
the last color has been assigned, the initial display will be repeated:

          Current User-Definable Map Colors

          -----  5 Local Station Color
          -----  6 Isocontour Color
          -----  4 Tracking Station Color


          Press ENTER to ACCEPT, SPACE to CHANGE:

Press ENTER if the new colors are acceptable, or press SPACE BAR again to 
change again.


F10    Enable/Disable Printer Logging
-------------------------------------
     I have found it interesting to log the orbital data and the ascending 
and descending node information on my printer when analyzing the mission 
data over long periods of time. The F10 command toggles the printer logging 
function on and off. The first page of the log includes the current orbital 
data and subsequent pages contain only node information. In addition to the 
information presented on the display, the printer log also calculates the 
current orbital time, the time from one ascending (descending) node to the 
next, for the third and subsequent nodes. A typical log is shown below. 

     IMPORTANT:     BE SURE THE PRINTER IS TURNED ON PRIOR TO ENTERING THE 
                    F10 COMMAND.

     When printer logging is enabled and the ground track is displayed, the 
word "LOG" will appear in yellow at the upper right of the display. 
Enabling printer logging also automatically enables the display of 
ascending and descending node information.
     The Launch Date and Launch Time entries are given if that information 
has been entered independently. The Epoch Date and Epoch Time are always 
shown. Note also that the orbit altitude shown is the altitude at the time 
the log was started and will not be correct for subsequent entries, 
especially if the satellite has an elliptical orbit (high eccentricity).
     A printer log may be prepared in advance of a mission by enabling 
printer logging from the Set Options Menu (with the F10+F10 command), 
setting the desired simulation time (F8+F3 command), then starting the 
ground track display with ENTER; once the ground track has appeared on the 
screen, pressing the F key twice to set STSPLUS in the X60 fast time mode 
will generate the date relatively quickly (although the UT TIME printed may 
be off by as much as one minute in the X60 mode). Allow the simulation to 
run for the desired length of time, then press ENTER to return to the Main 
Menu. While the ground track is active Function Key F3 performs the same 
function as the F10+F10 command to enable or disable printer logging.

SET DISPLAY FEATURES
--------------------

     Depending upon the satellite and personal preferences, a variety of 
display features may be enabled or disabled. Not all features are available 
with monochrome or CGA monitors. Pressing F3 on the Set Program Options and 
Features Menu will display the following menu:

         Select desired function:


F1     Select Satellite Icon Size: 15/21 pixels
-----------------------------------------------

     This command allows the user to select the size of the internal 
satellite icons used to display the ground track position of the primary 
satellite. The choices are: 15x15 pixels, which should be suitable for most 
applications; and, 21x21 pixels for television and display or projection 
formats where higher visibility of the satellite icon is desired. This 
selection has no effect when external icon files (files with names 
"#nnnnn.ICN") are used; each external icon file includes its own icon 
size parameter which is independent of the internal icon size selection.
     NOTE: For compatibility with earlier versions, the 21x21 pixel size 
may also be enabled by the "/21" command line option. However, unlike those 
earlier versions, the current icon size is now saved in file STSPLUS.INI 
and the smaller size is NOT selected by default when the program is 
executed. Once the 21x21 icon size is selected (by either method), the 
small 15x15 icon size must be re-selected using F10+F3+F1.

F2     Display TDRS and Real Time Satellites
--------------------------------------------

     This command allows the user to display TDRS and/or selected real time 
and static satellites. The command cycles through "OFF", "TDRS", "SATS", 
and "BOTH". When "TDRS" or "BOTH" is selected,the communications coverage 
for the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS) or other geosynchronous 
satellites is also shown. The TDRS coverage boundaries overlap between the 
East and West TDRS satellites and Mission Control may select either 
satellite during the overlap period. STSPLUS displays the areas covered by 
each satellite and the times for acquisition and loss of signal (AOS and 
LOS). See the section "TDRS and Real Time Satellite Features" above for a 
full discussion of the TDRS coverage features.


F3     Display Additional Map Grid Lines
----------------------------------------

     This command is not available for CGA systems. The basic world map 
includes the Equator and the meridians at 0 degrees (Prime Meridian) and 
180 degrees (International Date Line) shown in bright blue on color 
monitors. Turning on the map grid adds additional lines of longitude and 
latitude. Displaying the additional grid lines on some monochrome monitors 
may make the screen too "busy".
     In the Orthographic, Quadrant and Zoom Map modes, the spacing of the 
additional grid lines is adjusted for the map field of view. In all 
rectangular map modes and for orthographic map modes with MAG > 500 except 
for polar and near polar views, each latitude grid line is labeled at the 
left and each longitude grid line at the top or bottom of the display 
screen.


F4     Display Tracking Stations
--------------------------------

     The F4 command enables/disables the display of the tracking stations 
included in file STSPLUS.TRK or the current TRACKING STATION filename as 
set by Function Key F7 on the Main Menu. If that file is not found, 
internal data are used for NASA's 14 original ground tracking stations plus 
the NASA Ground Terminal at White Sands, NM. Each tracking station is 
located with a small red circle. The circle of visibility is also shown if 
that circle has an angular diameter of 90 degrees or less. The circles of 
visibility are calculated at the instant the map is drawn and may not be 
accurate over long periods of time for satellites with highly eccentric 
orbits. For all map modes EXCEPT the World Maps, each tracking station is 
also labeled with its 3-character abbreviation. This command is not 
available for CGA monitors.


F5     Display Ground Track: DOTS/LINE
--------------------------------------
Š     STSPLUS calculates the ground track for the satellite for a period 
from one and one half hours in the past to three hours in the future. Press 
F5 to change from one mode to the next. Depending upon the user's 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 171


preferences, this function may be used to set the displayed ground track to 
any of the following modes:

     NONE      The ground track is not displayed.

     DOTS      The ground track is displayed using RED dots for the past 
               ground track and GREEN dots for the future ground track. The 
               dots are spaced at one minute intervals. As time passes, the 
               GREEN dots will change to RED.

     LINE      The ground track is displayed using a GREEN line.

     BOTH      The ground track is displayed using a GREEN line with RED 
               dots for past ground track minute marks and YELLOW dots for 
               future ground track minute marks. As time passes, the YELLOW 
               dots will change to RED.


F5     Display Local/Satellite Circles of Visibility
----------------------------------------------------

     Function Key F6 enables and disables the local and satellite circles 
of visibility, cycling through OFF, LCL, SAT, and BOTH with successive key 
presses. These abbreviations have the following meaning:

     OFF       Both the local and satellite circles of visibility are 
               disabled.

     LCL       The local circle(s) of visibility are enabled; the satellite 
               circle of visibility is disabled.

     SAT       The satellite circle of visibility is enabled; the local 
               circle(s) of visibility are disabled.

     The local circle of visibility is centered on your location and a 
second location (if enabled), and shows the approximate area within which 
direct line of sight communication with the satellite is possible. The 
local circle of visibility is calculated at the instant the map is drawn 
and may not be accurate over long periods of time for satellites with 
highly eccentric orbits. In some situations (geosynchronous satellites, for 
example), these circles of visibility cover so large an area that they 
simply confuse and clutter the display; use this command to disable the 
local circles in this case.
     The satellite circle of visibility shows the approximate circle of 
visibility from the spacecraft, the area of the Earth's surface which is 
visible from the cockpit windows and television cameras or, for unmanned 
spacecraft, the direct line of sight visibility from the ground. Note that 
the shape of the "circle" varies depending upon the magnification or zoom 
factor and map projection being used. With rectangular projection, the 
shape is approximately a circle near the Equator and more like a rounded 
triangle at higher latitudes; near the poles, the "circle" spreads out 
across the map. This is an artifact of the rectangular map projection.Š     When enabled, the satellite circle of visibility is recalculated every 
10 seconds based upon the spacecraft's current altitude. This means that 
orbits with a high eccentricity (that is, a highly elliptical orbit whose 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 172


apogee and perigee are very different) will exhibit a constantly changing 
circle of visibility.


F7     Display South Atlantic Anomaly Zone
------------------------------------------

     The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is an area in the southern hemisphere 
lying between the southern tip of Africa and South America which can cause 
severe electromagnetic disturbances on spacecraft, often referred to as a 
Single Event Upset (SEU). For example, the semiconductor memory on the 
Hubble Space Telescope (which regularly passes through the SAA) was being 
changed by this phenomenon, with resulting erratic performance, until a 
software patch was uplinked to work around the problem. The SAA may be 
displayed on the ground track display in either projection and is shaped 
more or less like a kidney bean. Using NASA Mission Charts (now long out of 
print, unfortunately) for various Space Shuttle missions as a reference, 
the SAA has been modeled for spacecraft in low Earth orbits with altitudes 
from 140 nm to 330 nm (although it actually extends out to geosynchronous 
orbits). This model is then interpolated for altitudes from 75 to 1000 nm.
     The extent of the SAA is shown as estimated for the orbital altitude 
of the Primary Satellite and may not accurately reflect the extent of the 
SAA for Secondary satellites. Because the accuracy of the SAA model is not 
known at higher altitudes, it is not drawn if the spacecraft altitude is 
above 1000 nm. Users should be aware that this is only an approximate model 
and that the SAA's effects and extent may vary considerably with time and 
as a function of the type of interference or radiation that is of interest. 
Note also that the minimum altitude used for the SAA is 75 nautical miles; 
this applies when ascent simulation is enabled with the Space Shuttle on 
the launch pad and during ascent.


F8     Display Terminator, Sun, and SpaceCraft Lighting
-------------------------------------------------------


     This function enables and disables the Sun and related solar features. 
See the section "Sun and Solar Features" for a full discussion. STSPLUS 
calculates whether the spacecraft is in full sun, penumbra (partial shadow) 
or refracted sunlight, or umbra (full shadow) and adjusts the color of the 
spacecraft icon accordingly: bright white, yellow, and dim white 
respectively. This feature is not available on CGA and HGC monitors. The 
current spacecraft solar lighting is indicated in the data block (next to 
"Orbit #:") by the following symbols:

     *    Full sunlight
     +    Partial sunlight (penumbra)
     -    Refracted sunlight
          Full shadow (umbra)

F9     Display Map Locations and Features
-----------------------------------------

     This feature enables or disables the display of the map locations and 
features contained in file STSPLUS.LOC if present. See the section 
"Location and Features Labels" above for a full discussion.


F10    Display Lakes and Rivers
-------------------------------

     This feature enables or disables the display of lakes and rivers on 
the map. Removing the lakes and rivers will lessen the time required to 
draw a map and can improve screen legibility especially for CGA systems. 
(The lakes and rivers are always disabled on the rectangular world map to 
avoid cluttering an already busy display!)

STSORBIT PLUS's Orbital Model
-----------------------------

     The original version of STSORBIT was first prepared without reference 
materials of any kind and the simplest possible orbital model was therefore 
selected. The primary objective was to duplicate the NASA wall map at 
the Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas. This "simple" model assumed 
that the orbit was perfectly circular at a specified altitude and 
inclination which never degraded due to other factors such as drag or 
perturbation. Some simplifying assumptions were incorporated to handle the 
initial ascent portion of a mission and the launch site was hard coded to 
Cape Canaveral, Florida. With only minor modifications, the program was 
essentially unchanged for the next year.
     The launch of STS-31 and the Hubble Space Telescope highlighted the 
need for improved accuracy because of public interest and the length of the 
mission. The orbital calculations were modified (STSORBIT Version 9015) to 
include the J2 factor, the perturbation of low Earth orbits due to 
variations in the gravitational field related to the non-spherical shape of 
the Earth (among other factors); omission of the J2 factor caused errors in 
longitude of approximately -5 to -7 degrees per day. That is, the orbital 
track drifted Westward from its true position by that amount. More accurate 
models of low orbits also include the J3 and J4 perturbation factors, 
atmospheric drag, and a host of other less significant items.
     Although reasonably accurate for the first day or so of a space 
shuttle mission, the "simple" model is by no means ideal. In calculating 
the current orbital longitude, for example, the "simple" model assumes a 
circular orbit. For orbits with low inclinations, as is typical for 
launches from Kennedy Space Center, the errors are not particularly 
significant and are probably overshadowed by the fundamental uncertainties 
in orbital parameters and by the limitations imposed by display resolution. 
Orbits with higher inclinations, as would be the case if near-polar 
launches from Vandenberg AFB in California are ever initiated, would have 
much larger periodic errors which would be both noticeable and 
objectionable. More important for longer missions and for general satellite 
tracking is the fact that due to the method used, errors in the orbital 
calculations tend to be cumulative. After a day or two, the errors become 
unacceptably large.
     The real problem with the simple method, of course, is that the Earth 
is not a perfect sphere and actual satellite orbits are never perfectly 
circular. Satellite orbits are significantly perturbed by the non-spherical
gravitational field of the Earth, by the Sun and Moon, atmospheric drag, 
and other factors. Accurate satellite tracking over longer periods of time 
therefore demands more accurate data and a more rigorous treatment of 
satellite orbits. The only practical alternative is to use the NASA/NORAD 
2-line orbital element sets. Not only are these data readily available 
publicly, but they are relatively accurate and are updated regularly. 
Therefore, STSORBIT PLUS relies on the NORAD SGP4 prediction model and the 
2-line orbital element sets for orbit predictions. 2-line element sets for 
non-military space shuttle missions are typically available on the same day 
as the launch. Amateur astronomers and satellite tracking experts often 
generate "unofficial" 2-line element sets even for military missions.
     Six quantities are required by classical gravitational theory to Šcompletely characterize the orbit of one body about another in time and 
space, the "Two Body Problem". These six quantities, often referred to as 
Keplerian orbital elements, are included in the NASA/NORAD 2-line element 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 175


sets along with other numerical and statistical data. The U.S Space 
Command, (formerly NORAD, the North American Air Defense Command) 
headquartered in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, developed the SGP4 and SDP4 
orbital models and the 2-line element format many years ago as part of 
their satellite tracking efforts and NASA subsequently adopted the same 
format -- more or less. NASA and NORAD do not always use the same 
definition for revolution (orbit) numbers; NASA frequently gives a number 
one (or two) greater than NORAD, calling the first partial orbit number one 
while NORAD calls that same partial orbit number zero. Except for short 
duration missions, such as the Space Shuttle, revolution numbers are of no 
practical importance.
     Having timely and accurate orbital data is of little help without a 
computer model or program which can use those data. NORAD has rather 
arbitrarily divided satellite orbits into two categories: near Earth orbits 
and deep space orbits. Near Earth orbits are defined as those with orbital 
periods of 225 minutes or less and deep space orbits are all others. 
Computer models are described in the literature for each category. STSORBIT 
PLUS employs the SGP4 Near Earth Model only, using a composite of code of 
my own combined with translated Fortran and Basic source supplied by Paul 
Traufler and C source by Paul Hirose. I plan to add the SDP4 deep space 
model in due course. Not only are the near Earth orbits generally of more 
interest to observers, but the errors associated with deep space orbits 
processed with the SGP4 model (rather than the correct SDP4 model) are not 
particularly significant for the purposes of a program such as STSORBIT 
PLUS. Further, watching a geostationary satellite orbit on the screen is 
not unlike watching grass grow and is about as exciting.

Accurate Time and the Personal Computer
---------------------------------------

     For a program like STSPLUS, accuracy and precision of the timekeeping 
functions are essential. There is a tendency these days to accept whatever 
a computer says as the absolute truth without regard for whether or not the 
information is even "reasonable". For something as basic as time, even an 
experienced computer user may assume that it is correct. This discussion 
attempts to compare reality with that expectation.
     Given the clock drift and accuracy problems inherent in the design of 
the typical IBM-compatible personal computer, frequent time setting and/or 
adjustments are required. Accurate time setting would not be practical 
for most people without the various time services provided by the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Naval Observatory 
(USNO). The NIST radio stations WWV and WWVH provide an inexpensive and 
convenient means for "ordinary folks" to synchronize clocks and other 
equipment. The NIST and USNO Telephone Time Services offer a high precision 
standard time calibration source when such accuracy is required. Similar 
radio and telephone services are available in Canada and Europe.
     Once a computer clock has been set with reasonable accuracy, the 
accuracy of the computer's clock will indeed be sufficient for many 
applications; if you are using a word processing or spreadsheet program, 
knowing the time to within a minute or two is probably adequate. For 
programs such as STSPLUS and other time-dependent applications, however, 
this level of accuracy simply will not suffice; when used for satellite 
tracking, the time should be accurate to within a second. Unless steps are 
taken to both set the clock and to maintain its accuracy, this will not be 
the case. No matter how accurately the clock on a typical personal computer 
is set, it will only be a matter of hours before the time will have drifted 
by some seconds. Measured over a number of days, the accumulated errors can 
easily amount to a minute or more.
     The timekeeping operations of an IBM-compatible computer are actually 
performed by two separate and independent functions: a clock-calendar 
CMOS integrated circuit and lithium battery combination which maintains the 
current time and date in hardware; and, a section of the DOS operating 
system software which maintains the current time and date in software. When 
computer power is off, the hardware chip continues to operate using its 
battery; when the computer is started ("booted"), the operating system 
software reads the hardware clock and sets its internal software clock. 
Absent special software, the DOS time thereafter relies entirely on the 
software clock until the next time the computer is restarted. 
Unfortunately, neither of these clocks was designed for accuracy; early 
versions of the PC did not even include the hardware/battery arrangement. 
Even the typical electric clock, which uses the power line frequency for 
its timekeeping reference, is usually far more accurate.
     The accuracy of the DOS time at any instant is the result of the 
accumulated errors in both clocks. The hardware clock will drift as a 
function of time, temperature, voltage, and crystal aging; the software 
clock will gain or lose time depending upon the skill with which its 
software was written and how well that software "cooperates" with the 
balance of the computer's hardware and software. Some software, especially 
network and high speed communications software, can prevent the DOS clock Šsoftware from incrementing when it should, usually resulting in the DOS 
clock losing time. The problem was compounded with the release of DOS 
Version 3.3; beginning with that version, the DOS TIME and DATE commands 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 177


adjust BOTH the hardware and software clocks and thereby potentially 
eliminate the hardware clock as even a modestly reliable reference.


Methods for Setting DOS Time
----------------------------

     Bearing these considerations in mind, there are a number of approaches 
to the computer time question. The most obvious approach, used by the vast 
majority of computer users, is to either ignore the computer clock entirely 
or to say "It's close enough". Regardless of the application, I strongly 
recommend that the computer's clock be REGULARLY set to the correct time if 
only to assure that files are more or less correctly date and time stamped. 
If the accuracy of computer time is important, the computer clock may be 
set or synchronized in a number of ways, some of which are described below. 
In this context, "ACCURACY" means the accuracy of the time setting 
operation and NOT the longer term accuracy and stability of the computer's 
clock.

1.   TELEPHONE: Many local telephone companies offer a telephone time 
     service, usually with a message such as "When you hear the signal the 
     time will be ... (beep)". I am not aware of any hardware or software
     which uses this signal for time setting purposes.

     ACCURACY: Generally plus or minus 5 seconds. With the advent of 
     digital voice response equipment in recent years, the accuracy has 
     improved to perhaps plus or minus 1 second.

2.   COMMERCIAL RADIO: Hourly time signals broadcast on commercial radio 
     may be used to manually set the time. My experience suggests that the 
     CBS network time signal is usually reliable.

     ACCURACY: Usually within plus or minus 2 seconds, depending upon the 
     source. Satellite distribution of network feeds adds a time delay of 
     approximately 0.25 seconds per "hop" but some stations, including some 
     network stations, generate time signals locally.

3.   SHORTWAVE RADIO: Time signals are broadcast on shortwave radio 
     stations WWV and WWVH by the National Institute of Standards and 
     Technology. These time signals may be used to manually set the time. 
     WWV and WWVH broadcast on several frequencies: 2.5MHz, 5MHz, 10MHz, 
     15MHz, and 20 MHz (WWV only). Reception will vary according to your 
     distance from the transmitter, time of day, and atmospheric 
     conditions. These time signals are very precise; the only major 
     variable is the propagation delay, the time it takes the radio signal 
     to travel from the transmitter to your receiver. The typical 
     propagation delay is approximately 5 microseconds per mile. Outside 
     North America, other national radio services such as the British 
     Broadcasting Company's BBC World Service offer accurate hourly 
     shortwave time signals.

     ACCURACY: Time setting using WWV or WWVH can usually be performed to Š     within about plus or minus 250 milliseconds, of which up to 25 
     milliseconds is transmission time and the balance is user response 
     time. With practice, plus or minus about 100 milliseconds is 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 178


     practical.

4.   HEATH GC-1000 MOST ACCURATE CLOCK: The GC-1000 is a combination 
     digital clock and scanning shortwave radio receiver which may be 
     equipped with an RS-232 communications port for use with computers and 
     other electronic equipment. Operation with DC power is available to 
     maintain accurate time during periods of AC power loss. This is the 
     only method which provides more or less continuous accurate time 
     information without telephone toll charges.

     ACCURACY: When properly configured for your location, equipped with an 
     external antenna, used with appropriate computer software, and when 
     the receiver is locked to one of the WWV (or WWVH) time signals, the 
     GC-1000 can provide time information and a standard calibration 
     frequency to an accuracy of plus or minus 10 milliseconds. When signal 
     lock is lost, the receiver scans the 5MHz, 10MHZ, and 15MHz broadcasts 
     to reacquire signal and lock. Even after signal lock is lost, the 
     receiver maintains an accuracy of plus or minus 100 milliseconds for 
     some hours.

5.   NIST/USNO TELEPHONE TIME SERVICE: When real precision and accuracy are 
     required, the computer clock may be set remotely using the telephone 
     time service of either the National Institute of Standards and 
     Technology (NIST, formerly the National Bureau of Standards or NBS) in 
     Boulder, Colorado, or the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) in Washington, 
     D.C. This method requires a modem connected to a telephone line and is 
     available for systems using DOS version 3.3 or higher AND equipped 
     with 80286 processor or higher; some 8088-equipped systems may also 
     use this method depending upon the type of clock hardware installed 
     and the version of DOS being used. 

     ACCURACY: This is the most accurate method available for setting and 
     maintaining the DOS clocks. Depending upon which service is used, NIST 
     or USNO, whether or not line delay compensation ("lag") is employed, 
     and the frequency of time setting, the DOS time can be set to within 
     plus or minus 2 milliseconds. However, since the "time ticks" of the 
     DOS software clock occur every 55 milliseconds, or 18.2 times per 
     second, this "granularity" may limit the accuracy of reading the DOS 
     clocks.

6.   INTERNET TIME SERVICES: A number of software programs are available to 
     set the computer's clock via the Internet. An Internet connection is 
     required only when the time setting function is performed. One of the 
     programs I use is DIMENSION 4.

     ACCURACY: Generally to within approximately one second. However, if 
     the Internet is especially busy, delays may degrade the accuracy to 
     several seconds.

7.   GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM: Although usually associated with precise 
     position determination, the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites 
     carry a high precision atomic clock on board each satellite. Using a Š     GPS receiver equipped with a serial port, appropriate cable, and 
     software, the GPS time signal may be used to synchronize the 
     computer's clock. I have both the DeLorme Tripmate and GARMIN 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 179


     receivers and use my own GPSSYNC software to set the computer's clock.

     ACCURACY: Although the GPS satellite clocks are extremely precise and 
     theoretical accuracies on the ground on the order of microseconds or 
     less are possible, typical consumer GPS receivers only send out a time 
     signal once every second or two, typically at 4800 baud. The result is 
     that setting the computer clock using this method is usually only 
     accurate to one or two seconds.

     Choose one of the methods suggested or a suitable alternative based 
upon your precision and accuracy requirements. Other methods of maintaining 
an accurate time standard such as atomic clocks, Global Positioning 
Satellite (GPS) time receivers, and NIST time code equipment, are also 
available -- for a price. Those methods are beyond the scope of this 
documentation.


Maintaining Accurate DOS Time
-----------------------------

     Just in case you missed the point earlier, accurately setting DOS time 
is only half the battle. Even if the DOS time is set very precisely as 
discussed above, all that assures is that the time is correct to the 
required accuracy at that instant. The problem then becomes one of knowing 
how the DOS clocks change or drift with time and how to compensate for 
those changes or, alternatively, checking the DOS time frequently enough 
that any drift on the part of the DOS clocks is acceptable for the intended 
application.
     Of the two clocks in a typical personal computer, the hardware clock 
is considerably more consistent and reliable. I have checked perhaps a 
dozen PC hardware clocks in recent years, and almost all kept reasonably 
good time over a period of several days; as expected, none kept "perfect" 
time. Typical drift rates ranged from about 3 seconds per day to near zero 
seconds per day, with the magnitude and direction of the drift more or less 
constant over the period of measurement. The hardware clock is typically 
sensitive to both voltage and temperature, both of which undergo 
significant change when the computer is turned on or off. Complete 
calibration of the hardware clock requires knowledge of its performance 
under both circumstances. Once a hardware clock has been calibrated, 
its performance may be predicted with reasonable accuracy over periods of 
some weeks or more. Crystal aging rates suggest that calibration should be 
performed at least monthly.
     The hardware clock is normally interrogated only when the computer is 
first started or rebooted. The correct time can therefore be predicted at 
that moment for a calibrated hardware clock, given the last time that clock 
was synchronized with an appropriate time standard. Microsoft provides no 
standard software tools for interrogating the hardware clock at other 
times except for low level interrupt services. Quite the contrary; 
beginning with DOS Version 3.3, using the DOS TIME and DATE commands to set 
the DOS software clock will also set the hardware clock and effectively 
destroy its usefulness as a calibrated time reference. I am at a complete 
loss to understand the reasoning behind this change in DOS; I presume that Šusers were being "confused" by differences between the hardware and 
software clocks; instead of either explaining or fixing the problem, 
Microsoft elected to "legislate" the problem away -- a process any 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 180


politician would recognize instantly. The only mitigating consideration is 
that any really effective solution would probably require hardware as well 
as software changes. Blame IBM, I guess.
     The software clock provides the only time information readily 
accessible to DOS using standard software. Since this clock is maintained 
entirely in software, with no reference to the hardware clock except at 
bootup, it is at the mercy of other software which may execute from time to 
time. The software clock increments its time using "interrupts", a 
technique which stops a software process in progress just long enough to do 
the required tasks and then resumes the interrupted process. These 
interrupts occur every 55 milliseconds. So long as none is missed, the 
software clock should keep accurate time -- if the software is written 
correctly and if the computer's crystal controlled oscillator is in turn 
accurate. It may be that neither of these conditions is true; certainly the 
crystal controlled oscillator (quite similar to the one which runs the 
hardware clock) was not designed for accuracy or stability. It's original 
purpose was solely to generate the necessary timing signals for the 
operation of the computer. Cost, not accurate time, was the primary 
consideration in its design.
     Other software designers have contributed to the problem by writing 
software which, deliberately or inadvertently, prevents the software clock 
from being updated. Off-brand BIOS firmware can present occasional 
problems. Local Area Network (LAN) and high speed communications software 
are also frequent culprits in this respect. For example, a casual check of 
the clock while using a high speed computer-to-computer file transfer 
program indicated that the clock was effectively suspended when data 
transfers were in progress. In one relatively brief test, the DOS clock 
lost about 30 seconds.
     As a result of all of these factors, the accuracy of the DOS software 
clock can vary wildly from one computer to the next and from one situation 
to another. One inexpensive "clone" computer that I'd rather forget 
couldn't manage to keep time to better than about 30 seconds per HOUR! 
Before planning to use a particular computer as a time reference with 
programs like STSPLUS, check the computer hardware and software you intend 
to use very carefully.

The Internet and Computer Bulletin Board Systems
------------------------------------------------

     Until about 1995, the only means of obtaining accurate 2-line elements 
electronically was via computer bulletin board systems. Dr. TS Kelso's 
Celestial BBS was the first to make these data available on a timely basis 
and made accurate satellite tracking by the general public practical for 
the first time. Prior to Celestial BBS, GSFC Orbital Information Group sent 
TLEs by mail and the data had to be manually transcribed, a time consuming 
and error prone process which yielded TLEs which were already somewhat 
outdated. With the meteoric rise of the Internet, the BBSs which I used to 
frequent have disappeared at a rapid rate and my own RPV Astronomy BBS is 
scheduled to shut down at the end of 1999.
     The following Internet sites make my software and/or 2-line elements 
publicly available.

     Dave Ransom Home Page    http://www.dransom.com
     NASA Spacelink           http://spacelink.nasa.gov
     NASA GSFC/OIG            http://oig1.gsfc.nasa.gov
                                   /scripts/foxweb.dll/app01?
     TS Kelso WWW Site        http://celestrak.com
     TS Kelso FTP Site        ftp://celestrak.com

     Timely 2-line orbital elements are essential for accurate satellite 
tracking. In addition to my WWW Home Page, other Internet sites provide 
authoritative data for the general public. My recommended sites are listed 
above. Some or all files on these systems are compressed to reduce download 
time and must be decompressed before use; compressed files may be 
recognized by file types such as ".ZIP", ".ARJ", ".ARC", ".PAK", ".Z", etc.


                            ******************
                            *  CAUTION NOTE  *
                            ******************

          Until recently, cross-platform compatibility problems were 
     all but non-existent. PC files stayed with PCs, MAC files with 
     MACs, and so forth. UNIX files were relatively rare in the PC 
     world. With the increasing use of the Internet (which is usually 
     hosted by a UNIX system), files often migrate from one platform 
     to another and this process may not be obvious to the user.
          The use of the Internet for data distribution, therefore, has 
     meant that UNIX and MAC files often find their way to a PC. TLE 
     files from NASA Spacelink are a case in point. Text and ASCII 
     data files which have been prepared or processed by a UNIX system 
     terminate each text line with LF (Line Feed) alone rather than 
     with CR+LF (Carriage Return plus Line Feed) which is the DOS 
     standard. MACs use CR only as a line terminator.
          STSPLUS reads TLE files in all three formats correctly and 
     resaves the files in DOS format if required. However, some DOS 
     programs will not correctly read these files; most DOS editors 
     (such as QEDIT by SemWare Corp.) will correctly interpret UNIX Š     and MAC text files and will save the files in the standard DOS 
     format. The process is usually completely transparent to the 
     user; simply load the file into the editor, make a trivial edit, 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 182


     and then resave it.
          To compound the problem, most printers DO print UNIX files 
     correctly. Printing a suspect file as a test may NOT reveal the 
     problem. Use the DOS "TYPE" command to view a suspect file. If 
     text lines appear scattered all over the screen, it is UNIX or 
     MAC formatted and may have to be corrected before use in most DOS 
     programs.


     I maintained my RPV Astronomy BBS (computer bulletin board system) as 
a public service beginning in November of 1987; it is scheduled to shut 
down on 31 December 1999 after more than 12 years of continuous service. 
Support for and calls to my BBS have fallen precipitously since the peak 
year of 1995 when up to 400 calls were received daily on two phone lines. 
By mid-1999 the call rate was often only 1 or 2 calls per day as callers 
abandoned BBSs for the Internet. It was fun while it lasted ...
     In November 1996 I opened a new WWW Home Page on the Internet to 
provide greater access to my software and current files. It is available at 
the following address:

          http://www.dransom.com

My Home Page has a selection of files incuding my software (STSPLUS, 
ASTROCLK, ORBITEL, etc.) and current TLEs from US Space Command (via Dr. TS 
Kelso) and NASA GSFC/OIG. Current TLEs and files of interest for space 
shuttle missions in progress are also posted.
     Our STSTLE Team, consisting of David Cottle, Ken Ernandes, and myself, 
generate space shuttle TLEs during supported missions using state vectors 
supplied by Dave Simonson and his colleagues at the DOD C-Band Radar 
Network Control Center, Cape Canaveral. The data are very accurate and are 
regularly verified by the DOD C-Band Radar Network. Three or four sets of 
TLEs and state vectors are generated daily. These data are posted on my 
Home Page and are available via e-mail on the Internet. If you wish to 
receive these data, send a message to:

          listproc@spacelink.nasa.gov

Leave the subject blank and put the following text in your message:

          subscribe ststle Firstname Lastname

Substitute your real first and last names for "Firstname" and "Lastname". 
You will receive an acknowledgement and instructions for unsubscribing.

     Since the mid-1980s, Dr. T. S. Kelso, Col. USAF, has been making the 
US Space Command (formerly NORAD) orbital data available as a public 
service. Data are available on the Internet at:

          http://celestrak.com

The 2-line element sets are prepared by Kelso using data received directly 
from U.S. Space Command (formerly NORAD) by special arrangement. I Šregularly post a concatenated and sorted version of the current element 
sets on my home page as file TLEnnn.ZIP, where "nnn" is a number such as 
"530", the current Prediction Bulletin number. Kelso provides data for 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 183


several categories of satellites:  Amateur Radio, Earth Resources, Manned 
Spacecraft, Navigation, Weather, and NASA's 30 Day Specials (which contain 
objects launched within the last 30 days and are often easy to spot 
visually). More specifically, these include the following satellites or 
satellite series: OSCAR, Radio Sputnik, UOSAT, Cosmos, LandSat, SeaSat 1, 
SPOT, Mir, Salyut 7, Soyuz, Space Shuttle, NAVSTAR (GPS), GOES, Meteor, and 
NOAA.
    In keeping with the shift of most individuals to the Internet and to 
make most effective use of their facilities and budget, NASA SpaceLink in 
Huntsville, Alabama, discontinued dial-up access on July 1, 1997 in favor 
of their Internet site at:

          http://spacelink.nasa.gov

2-line elements for space shuttle missions in progress and selected 
satellites are also available. In addition, SpaceLink has a wealth of other 
NASA information, computer programs, teaching materials, and image files.
     In January of 1993 the Public Affairs Office at the NASA Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory began BBS service related to JPL-supported missions. 
Mission status reports and high quality GIF images are the principal files 
currently available. The last time I checked, in 1996, number was (818) 
354-1333, two lines at 1200 to 9600 baud. 2-Line Elements from Ted Molczan 
at the Canadian Space Society and from Allen Thomson are also available on 
the JPL Internet site:

          ftp://kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/space/elements

     A great (one might even say overwhelming) variety of information, 
including TLEs, is now available on the Internet. Instruction on the use 
of the Internet is beyond the scope of this documentation ... there are too 
many variations that are site and computer and software dependent.

STSORBIT PLUS Revision History
------------------------------

     Each released version of STSPLUS uses a four digit revision code such 
as 0123. The first two digits indicate the year and the second two digits 
indicate the week of the year. In some cases, an additional letter suffix 
is added to distinguish changes occurring within the same week or to 
identify special versions. A partial week at the beginning or end of the 
year is counted as a full week. Using this method, a year will typically 
have 53 weeks although it is possible to have 54 weeks in a leap year (1972 
is an example). The current year-week revision code is shown on the Julian 
Date display, Display Mode 7, in my program ASTROCLK.
     This file records the revision history of program STSPLUS through all 
of the minor twists and turns that usually accompany the evolution of such 
a complex program. It illustrates the tortuous process of maintaining and 
refining a program as ideas and problems are reported from every quarter. 
These notes may also be helpful to users who are upgrading from one version 
to another to find out what has changed.

Version 0123 -- June 2001
-------------------------
-This is a minor update to allow pass predictions to be made for satellites 
with mean motion as low as 1.1 as compared to the previous limit of 1.5.
-The amateur radio satellite, AMSAT OSCAR 40 with NORAD Number 26609, is 
one of the latest in a long series of AMSAT satellites. It's highly 
elliptical orbit has a Mean Motion (as of June 2001) of approximately 1.27. 
The prior lower limit to make pass predictions using F3 from the Main Menu 
was a Mean Motion of 1.5. This has been relaxed to a Mean Motion of 1.1.
-This documentation is essentially unchanged from the previous version.


Version 0114 -- April 2001
--------------------------
-This is a minor update to remove the internal MIR satellite icons and to 
increase the maximum size of external satellite icons to 25x25 pixels.
-With the deorbit of the Russian MIR Space Station in March, 2001, the
need for internal MIR satellite icons also disappeared. The internal MIR 
icons have therefore been removed.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 187


-Because of the increased size and complexity of the International Space 
Station (ISS), the permissible size of external icons has been increased to 
25x25 pixels. External icon files are prepared by my program STSICON, 
available with program registration, and are given filenames with the form 
"#nnnnn.ICN" for use with STSPLUS. The maximum internal icon size remains 
21x21 pixels.
-File ISS25.ICN is provided with this update and is a 25x25 pixel icon of 
the International Space Station as of April, 2001. Rename this file to 
#25544.ICN if you wish STSPLUS to use the new, larger icon for ISS.
-This documentation is essentially unchanged from the previous version.


Version 0034 -- August 2000
---------------------------
-This is a minor update to update the internal ISS icons and to correct a 
minor bug.
-Installed new 21x21 and 15x51 internal icons for the International Space 
Station to reflect the addition of the Zvezda module.
-Corrected Orbital Data Display (ALT-F1) of the Elements Epoch, NORAD 
format, to show the leading zeroes for years 2000 and above.
-Removed the Gamma Ray Observatory from the standard secondary satellites 
since that observatory has been deorbited.
-Added files STSISS2.ICN and STSISS2.NOT, the icon and instructions for the 
space shuttle docked to ISS, to the standard distribution package.
-The documentation is essentially unchanged from the previous version.


Version 0016 -- April 2000
--------------------------
-This is a MINOR UPDATE to improve communications with program STSUPDAT.
-Added IPC command to allow STSUPDAT to remove the "WAIT" message if no 
updates are performed.
-The documentation is essentially unchanged from Version 0012.


Version 0012 -- March 2000
--------------------------
-This is a MAJOR UPDATE to incorporate Greg Swift's STSUPDAT add-on program 
to automate the updating of orbital data (TLEs) via the Internet.

                           ********************
                           *  IMPORTANT NOTE  *
                           ********************
STSUPDAT requires a 32-bit operating system, Windows 95/98/NT/2K, as well 
as an active Internet connection at the time it is executed.

-Documentation only has been updated on 27 March to reflect the release of 
STSUPDAT Version 0014.
-Add Function Key F11 and CTRL-F2 to the available keys while the satellite 
tracking map is displayed. Either of these keys invokes STSUPDAT and allows 
the automatic updating of TLEs from my websites. See the section "Using 
STSPLUS with program STSUPDAT by Greg Swift" in the documentation as well Šas the documentation provided with STSUPDAT.
-To execute program STSUPDAT, LAN operations must be enabled with F10+F1 
from the STSPLUS Main Menu. LAN operations are disabled by default.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 188


-STSUPDAT may be downloaded from my STSPLUS Home Page at:

          http://www.dransom.com/stsplus.html

-Corrected coordinates for various locations in files STSPLUS.LOC and 
STSPLUS.CTY and removed a number of duplicate entries from STSPLUS.CTY. 
Thanks to Richard Stein for taking the time to figure out the corrections.
-Because most of the features of my planned program STSLAN have been 
incorporated in Greg Swift's STSUPDAT, development of STSLAN has been 
suspended and all references to it removed from the documentation.


Version 0005 -- January 2000
----------------------------
-This is a MINOR UPDATE to restore the internal link to TRAKSTAR, removed 
in Version 0002.
-In coordination with TS Kelso, the incompatibilities between Kelso's 
program TRAKSTAR and STSPLUS have been resolved with the release of 
TRAKSTAR Version 2.65. I have therefore restored the internal link which 
allows users to run TRAKSTAR from STSPLUS. STSPLUS writes file TRAKSTAR.CFG 
with the required information, including the new UTC Offset format and 
whether or not Daylight Savings Time is in use. STSPLUS also writes file 
STSPLUS.OB which contains the user's primary location and coordinates.
-Note that users MUST execute TRAKSTAR Version 2.65 and not the earlier 
Version 2.60. TRAKSTAR Version 2.60 will generate a Runtime Error 160 when 
executed from STSPLUS; the prior release, TRAKSTAR Version 2.15, is not Y2K 
compatible.


Version 0003 -- January 2000
----------------------------
-This is a MINOR UPDATE to correct a problem in STSAUX.
-Version 0002 of the support program STSAUX had a problem with the version 
number rollover from 9932 to 0002 which caused it to malfunction and 
display spurious information. This problem has been corrected.
-Except for the Version number, the documentation is unchanged from Version 
0002.


Version 0002 -- January 2000
----------------------------
-This is a MINOR UPDATE to remove the link to TRAKSTAR.
-Prior releases of STSPLUS have been able to execute TS Kelso's program 
TRAKSTAR V2.15. In the latter part of 1999, Kelso released TRAKSTAR V2.60 
to correct a number of Y2K-related problems and to add new features. 
Unfortunately, TRAKSTAR V2.60 is no longer compatible with STSPLUS and the 
link, F4 from the STSPLUS Main Menu, has been removed. Users must now 
execute TRAKSTAR independently of STSPLUS.
-Updated this documentation to remove all references to TRAKSTAR.
-Except for the removal of the link to TRAKSTAR, this release is 
essentially identical to Version 9932.
Š
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 189


Version 9932 -- August 1999
---------------------------
-This is a MAJOR UPDATE to add LAN features for automatic control of 
STSPLUS in a network environment.

                        **************************
                        *  Year 2000 Compliance  *
                        **************************
     STSPLUS has been subjected to a final round of Y2K testing to ensure 
     compliance with Year 2000. No Y2K problems are known as of Version 
     9848. STSPLUS supports 2-digit year entries: entries from 50 to 99 
     will be assigned to century 1900 and entries from 00 to 49 will be 
     assigned to century 2000. Note that these tests only verified that 
     STSPLUS executes correctly at and after the transition to Year 2000, 
     not that a particular computer and/or its clock will make the 
     transition correctly. Older computers may have BIOS or other systemic 
     problems in hardware and/or software which may prevent proper 
     operation at or after Year 2000 independent of the operation of 
     STSPLUS.

-STSPLUS can now operate in a Local Area Network (LAN) environment in 
conjunction with program STSLAN (planned to be released in the fall of 
1999 following completion of testing). The principal purpose of STSLAN is 
to maintain the TLEs used by STSPLUS and to force STSPLUS to re-initialize 
itself automatically when new TLEs are provided. STSLAN writes a new copy 
of file STSPLUS.INI (with updated TLEs) and a special inter-processor 
communications file called STSPLUS.IPC. The computer running STSLAN must 
have peer-to-peer access to the STSPLUS directory in order to read and 
write these files. When STSLAN provides updated TLEs in file STSPLUS.INI, 
it also writes file STSPLUS.IPC to signal STSPLUS to update. The STSPLUS 
user then sees an immediate screen redraw using the new TLE data. These LAN 
features have been tested using Lantastic 5.0 (DOS 6.22) and the Windows 
Network (Windows 95); other networks and configurations may execute 
properly but are untested. For installation instructions and additional 
details, see the documentation for program STSLAN when available.
-The LAN features in STSPLUS are OFF by default. Use F10+F1 to enable LAN 
features. The current status of LAN operation is saved in file STSPLUS.INI. 
Once enabled, the LAN features will remain enabled until disabled by 
F10+F1. If the LAN features are not being used, it is recommended that the 
LAN features be set to OFF to minimize disk activity.
-When used in a non-LAN environment or without program STSLAN, this version 
of STSPLUS executes the same as prior versions. STSPLUS does not itself use 
any LAN features.
-STSPLUS no longer "shells" to TS Kelso's program TRAKSTAR (using F4 from 
the Main Menu) but instead terminates STSPLUS and directly executes 
TRAKSTAR. This avoids the problem with insufficient memory common in recent 
releases but the user must restart STSPLUS manually. NOTE: The latest 
release of TRAKSTAR, Version 2A, crashes on my Win95 system with a runtime 
error and I continue to support Version 2 only.
-In order to reduce memory requirements to make room for new features, the 
maximum number of secondary satellites has been reduced from 48 to 32. When 
upgrading from prior versions, all secondary satellites past #32 will be Šlost. I had hoped to be able to keep up with constellations such as IRIDIUM 
but memory constraints limited the maximum number of secondary satellites 
to 48, a number which the IRIDIUM constellation soon exceeded. For most 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 190


other applications, 32 secondary satellites seems more than sufficient.
-Corrected the coordinates for Punta Arenas, Chile, in file STSPLUS.LOC 
thanks to Edward Aldridge. It no longer falls in the Straits of Magellan.
-Added supplementary prompt to F5 Launch Time and Date to remind users that 
the date format "DD.MM.YYYY" (European format) is also supported.
-Removed all references to programs TIMESET and RIGHTIME since they do not 
appear to be currently supported and I have received reports that they do 
not operate correctly under Win95/98/NT; so far as I know, the two programs 
have not been updated for some time. Removed all references to program 
PRECISION TIME since I understand that the program is no longer available.
-Removed references to my RPV Astronomy BBS. After 12 years of continuous 
service since it first went "on the air" on 1 November 1987, the BBS is 
scheduled to be shut down on 31 December 1999. Support for and calls to the 
BBS have fallen precipitously in recent years to the point where it is no 
longer worth the considerable personal effort to operate and maintain the 
system. From a high water mark of 400 calls per day in 1995, traffic is now 
only a few calls per day -- sometimes none at all. My thanks to everyone 
who supported the RPV Astronomy BBS. It was fun while it lasted ...


Version 9848 -- November 1998
-----------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE to add features for ISS and to correct a 
minor bug in the NORAD date.
-Added internal 15x15 and 21x21 satellite icons for ISS, the International 
Space Station. The icons depict the linked Zarya (FGB) and Unity modules as 
will be the case following the STS-88 mission in December of 1998. The 
internal icons may be overridden by providing a satellite icon file with 
the name "#25544.ICN".
-Added default satellite choice "ISS" if the TLE filename begins with 
"ISS". The TLEs with common name "ISS" will be selected from the file.
-Corrected the NORAD date (example: "98325.990313") which showed the 
incorrect day of the year at certain times if the UTC Offset was positive, 
as in Australia, in which case the day of the year was one day low. Thanks 
to Peter Bennett for reporting the error.
-Program documentation is essentially unchanged from Version 9838.


Version 9838 -- September 1998
------------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE to implement GPS capability (via my program 
GPSSYNC) and to correct several minor bugs and other upgrades/changes.
-A word of explanation: Thanks to my emergency major surgery for an 
aneurism in April followed by software work for NASA this summer, my usual 
update for STSPLUS has been delayed by some months ...
-I have added the capability to link directly to my new program GPSSYNC, 
Version 9838 or later, to obtain current GPS time and position. Use ALT-F2 
from the Main Menu to switch to program GPSSYNC. If GPSSYNC.EXE is not 
present in the STSPLUS directory, no action will occur. At this time, 
GPSSYNC has only been tested with GARMIN and DELORME GPS receivers. Other 
receivers may or may not operate properly. Program GPSSYNC is available 
separately from my Home Page or on disk via mail. Comments invited!Š-File WIN95.TXT provides an improved procedure for setting up STSPLUS under 
Windows 95/98. This procedure is RECOMMENDED for all Windows users! Thanks 
to Nicolas Biacona for the procedure!
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 191


-Repaired a bug in the TLE file selection process (F2 from the Main Menu) 
that caused STSPLUS to lock up the computer if there were no files with 
filetype .TXT or .TLE in the current TLE directory. The program now returns 
to the Main Menu when this occurs. Press F7+F1 from the Main Menu to set 
the TLE path correctly OR place the .TXT/.TLE files in the specified 
directory. Thanks to Trevor Smith for the bug report!
-Updated the displayed TLE filename if the Primary Satellite is among those 
updated with F2+& (auto-update).
-With the advent of faster and faster processors, the Motion Map could be 
drawn twice in a single second. I've added code to cause the program to 
wait until the next second before updating the Motion Map. There is no 
effect with slower processors.
-File STSLNDG.TRK has been updated to correct the locations of Miramar NAS 
and the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC. Thanks to Stuart Edwards for 
pointing out the errors!
-The small alphabet used for map labels has been upgraded to include 
accented characters (without the accents) for non-English users.
-Corrected the circle of visibility color around the station location(s) 
when night vision is enabled (ALT-R).
-Increased the length of Line 0 (common name) for the TLEs in file 
STSPLUS.INI from 15 to 20 characters to accommodate longer satellite names. 
However, the name length in the orthographic projection is still restricted 
to 19 characters by the screen layout so the 20th character may be 
truncated in that projection.
-Updated file GPS-PRN.SCF with the current operational GPS satellites as of 
15 September 1998. (The non-operational GPS satellites are not included.)
-The dial-up GSFC/OIG RBBS was shut down effective 01 July 1998 and I have 
deleted all references to it. GSFC/OIG data and information are now only 
available via the Internet. As of 04 September 1998, the GSFC/OIG website 
address is:

     http://oig1.gsfc.nasa.gov/scripts/foxweb.dll/app01?

-Various minor corrections and updates to this text.


Version 9748 -- December 1997
-----------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE to correct a problem with ALT-F1 from the 
Main Menu introduced in Version 9745.
-Corrected a problem with ALT-F1 when more than 32 secondary satellites 
were present. The program halted with an error if more than 32 were 
present. Count-specific code was replaced by code which will accept any 
number of secondary satellites.
-The text example display for ALT-F1 has been updated to reflect a slightly 
different format for the increased number of secondary satellites.
-Updated several Internet addresses and the GSFC/OIG RBBS telephone number.
-Added several entries to the Bibliography including Spacetrack Report #3.
-Except for the relatively minor changes and additions above, the text is 
otherwise unchanged from the prior release.
-A corrected version of IRIDIUM.SCF is also included. One satellite had the 
wrong NORAD Number.Š

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 192


Version 9747 -- November 1997
-----------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE to correct a problem with secondary 
satellites introduced in Version 9745.
-Edits for one source module for Version 9745 were omitted in the final 
release of that version and caused display problems when using F6 from the 
Main Menu. The problem has been corrected. My apologies ...
-I have included file IRIDIUM.SCF which contains data for the 39 Iridium 
satellites in active orbits as of 20 November 1997. When viewing the 
Iridium constellation, select any Iridium satellite as the Primary 
Satellite to accurately view your local circle of visibility. Iridium 
satelites in the lower orbits (Mean Motion = 14.3 or so) will yield the 
most accurate circle of visibility since they have the smallest surface 
area of visibility. I selected Iridium 8 for file IRIDIUM.SCF but the 
difference between the various Iridium satellites are relatively minor.
-Note that secondary satellites #1 and #2 must still be set up for TDRS 
satellites although their display may be disabled with F10+F3+F2 set to 
SATS. STSPLUS requires that secondary satellite positions #1 and #2 be set 
for geosynchronous satellites or improper operation may result.
-Use F6+F3 to load file IRIDIUM.SCF after first saving your present SCF 
file using F6+F2!


Version 9745 -- November 1997
-----------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE to increase the number of secondary 
satellites and to correct a minor bug.
-In an effort to "keep ahead" of the Motorola Iridium constellation, the 
number of secondary satellites has been increased to 48. As of this 
release, there are 34 Iridium satellites in orbit. Because of memory 
limitations, this will have to do for the moment ...
-Corrected the code to adjust the DOS clock if the Daylight Flag is changed 
using F8+F10. Versions since 9650 froze the program when this was done. The 
cause was a typographical error on a function declaration type. <mumble> 
Thanks to John Gresham for reporting the bug!


Version 9736 -- September 1997
------------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE, improving resolution on the manual map mode 
and correcting one minor problem.
-The resolution of the manual map mode ("L"+"/" while orthographic map is 
displayed) has been increased by a factor of two. Use of the arrow keys now 
moves the crosshair one half of the current grid spacing. The map center 
latitude and longitude are now displayed to the nearest 0.01 degrees 
instead of 0.1 degrees.
-Manual map mode now recognizes the primary and secondary locations.
-When entering map coordinates in manual map mode, the default latitude and 
longitude are now the current location, primary or secondary. Press ENTER 
to accept the default values shown.
-Corrected a constant typing problem (mixed type integer overflow within an 
expression) which caused automatic PCX file generation to fail if the Šnumbered file exceeded 327.


Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 193


Version 9733 -- August 1997
---------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE, adding a requested feature and correcting 
a minor problem. This update was released for beta test only.
-At the request of Dr. Konrad Moritz and Hr. Axel Wagner of the STS-85 
CRISTA-SPAS team, I have modified the Pass Predictions to provide the times 
in Mission Elapsed Time (MET) in addition to local time and UTC/GMT. 
STSPLUS is running on four PCs at the Payload Operations Control Center 
(POCC) at KSC and everything at the POCC is done using MET. When specifying 
the desired time for pass predictions, using "*" instead of the left letter 
of the desired time zone will provide the predictions in MET.
-At the risk of slowing pass predictions slightly, I've restored finer 
resolution to the search algorithm for LEO satellites that was changed some 
versions back. The difference from Version 9731 is one or two seconds on 
each time.
-If the primary satellite was changed using F6, STSAUX (called by ALT-F1) 
was unaware of the change and it would be lost. The problem has been 
corrected by always writing file STSPLUS.INI when using ALT-F1. Thanks to 
Geoffrey Anderson for reporting the bug!


Version 9731 -- July 1997
-------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE correcting a very rare bug which corrupted 
the displayed Time since Epoch ("T+E") and just happened to occur for the 
Mir Space Station when Version 9630 was released. The bug has been sitting 
there waiting to appear for YEARS. My thanks to Bill Vigasin for spotting 
and reporting the problem!
-After the initial release of Version 9731, a bug was discovered in the 
STSAUX.EXE file. When ALT-F1 was pressed, the satellite selection menu for 
orbital data overwrote the STSPLUS Main Menu in most cases (due to a 
missing CLEAR SCREEN statement). STSAUX.EXE has been repaired and the new 
file substituted for the bad file while keeping the same version number to 
avoid all the hassle of releasing yet another version. The repaired 
STSAUX.EXE is dated 30 JUL 97. My apologies!


Version 9730 -- July 1997
-------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE adding back a data display feature removed in 
Version 9726 for lack of memory and correcting several minor bugs.
-Because of memory constraints inherent in the use of DOS, I have had to 
split the EXE file for STSPLUS into two parts, a MAIN program and an 
AUXILIARY program. The main program is named STSPLUS.EXE, as before, and 
the auxiliary program is named STSAUX.EXE. Use of the two EXE files is 
transparent to the user. However, the main and auxiliary files MUST have 
the same Version Number or an error is detected and the auxiliary file will 
not execute. If STSAUX.EXE is not present in the STSPLUS directory, no 
action or error results from AUX-F1. I expect to add other new features to 
STSAUX in future releases.
-By popular request, I have added back the orbital data display removed at 
Version 9726 -- with an enhancement. Pressing ALT-F1 at the Main Menu will Šnow display a list of the Primary Satellite and all Secondary Satellites. 
The user may select any of these and present the orbital data. The initial 
orbital data display menu shows all available satellites:

Note that in this case the satellite is geosynchronous (TDRS5) and the last

satellites, defined here as those whose Mean Motion lies outside the range 
0.9 to 1.1. Data for all Secondary Satellites are derived from STSPLUS' 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 195


internal TLE data and the "Elements File" is so marked. For the Primary 
Satellite, MET will be displayed above T+E if the launch date has been set.
-Corrected the VGA PCX image size to 640x480 instead of 640x640. Thanks to 
Rob Stone for reporting the bug!
-When using F1 for help in rectangular projection and "/CLK" command line 
option, STSPLUS displayed BASIC ERROR = 5. The problem has been corrected. 
Thanks to Russ Nelson and Helmut Jonas for reporting the bug!
-When setting Launch Time and Date (F5 from the Main Menu), STSPLUS now 
displays a warning if no entry is found in file STSPLUS.LTD that the 
displayed default TIME and DATE are from the TLE epoch time and date. For 
satellites which have been in orbit for some time, this will have no 
relation to the actual launch time and date and should NOT be used!
-Replaced the default internal 21x21 space shuttle icon with one similar to 
an icon suggested by RS Smith. Use F10+F3+F1 to select 21x21 icons and then 
bring up a space shuttle mission. The new icon shows an outline of the 
orbiter. Comments invited! (I confess I didn't much like the shape and 
appearance of my old 21x21 icon ...)
-Corrected the coordinates for Sedona, AZ, in file STSPLUS.CTY; these 
coordinates are for the Sedona Airport. The latitude was incorrect due to a 
careless typo. Thanks to Conrad Suckow for spotting my error!


Version 9726 -- June 1997
-------------------------
-This is a FEATURES UPGRADE formalizing the new features and changes 
initially released as Beta Test Version 9707 as well as updating the 
program and documentation to reflect my move from Rancho Palos Verdes, 
California, to Sedona, Arizona, on June 1, 1997. Note my new mailing 
address and RPV Astronomy BBS number:

     David H. Ransom, Jr.
     240 Bristlecone Pines Road
     Sedona, AZ  86336  USA

     RPV BBS: (520) 282-5559

-Defaults which were "Rancho Palos Verdes, CA" or "Palos Verdes, CA" have 
been changed to "Sedona, AZ".
-Repaired several minor cosmetic bugs.
-RPV Astronomy BBS operations were suspended on 31 May 1997 from Rancho 
Palos Verdes, CA and resumed from Sedona, AZ on 08 June 1997. My WWW Home 
Page and e-mail continued uninterrupted during the move.
-The details of the remaining new features and changes are given in the 
update notes for Version 9707 which follow. Please also read that section.


Version 9707 -- February 1997
-----------------------------
-This is a Beta Test Version not intended for public distribution. This 
release follows Beta Test Versions 9704 and 9705 and further improves on 
the PCX features. Comments and suggestions are welcome.
-This is a FEATURES UPGRADE adding PCX Image File Generation, correcting Štwo bugs, and including several minor cosmetic changes.
-By popular request, I have added the capability to write a PCX image file 
of the tracking map at any time. This feature is only available with EGA 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 196


and VGA display adapters. Two methods are available to generate the PCX 
image file:

     MANUAL: While the map is displayed, pressing "*" will cause the 
     current map to be immediately written. This method is available 
     whether or not automatic PCX file generation is enabled.

     AUTOMATIC: The PCX image file may also be written by timed execution 
     at intervals of from 1 to 99 minutes. To enable or disable timed 
     execution of PCX Image File Generation, press F10 at the Main Menu 
     then press F4 to obtain the PCX Image File Generation Setup.

PCX Image File Generation may be used with either rectangular or 
orthographic map projection. The PCX image files use RLE (Run Length 
Encoding) to compress the image. For VGA images, the image file size ranges 
from approximately 50KB to 60KB; EGA images are somewhat smaller. The PCX 
Image File Generation flag is saved in file STSPLUS.INI and will remain in 
effect until changed. See the text section "Enable/Disable PCX Image File 
Generation" for further information.
-For users who prefer images in the GIF format, a 1989 shareware program 
called CVT2GIF (Version 1.5, author unknown) has been included in the 
distribution package. This small program converts the PCX image to a GIF 
image:

     CVT2GIF STSPLUS.PCX

Substitute the appropriate PCX filename if numbered files are used. The 
resulting GIF image is suitable for use on the Internet in WWW home pages. 
The typical file size of the GIF image is 25KB to 30KB.

     NOTE: PCX files written in EGA mode (either with the /EGA command line 
     option, the Motion Map enabled, or for systems equipped with an EGA 
     display adapter) may not display with the correct aspect ratio on 
     systems with a VGA display adapter; the vertical dimension may appear 
     "squeezed". The EGA uses the same 640 horizontal pixels but only 350 
     vertical pixels instead of 480 pixels for the VGA.

-A bug was inadvertently introduced at about Version 9650 which disabled 
the UP and DOWN arrow keys in Doppler mode. Proper operation of the UP/DOWN 
arrow keys in Doppler mode has been restored. Thanks to Peter Klein for 
reporting the problem! 
-F1 on the Main Menu is now "STSPLUS Program Information" so that the 
information is more readily available. The information has been updated to 
include my Home Page address on the Internet.
-The previous assignment of F10+F4, "Set Satellite Coordinates", has been 
removed. Satellite coordinates may now only be set using F10 while the 
tracking map is displayed.
-Because of compatibility problems with WinNT, all code related to the 
program RIGHTIME by Tom Becker has been removed. Clock synchronization and 
adjustment must now be performed external to STSPLUS.
-Since most computers now are equipped with a math coprocessor, the warning 
message for systems not equipped with a math coprocessor has been removed.Š-Removed ALT-F1 from the Main Menu (Orbital Data Display) to conserve 
memory. (References in the documentation may not have been removed ...)
-Standard 2-Line Elements (TLEs) are now readily available from multiple 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 197


sources including my RPV BBS and WWW home page. In order to save memory, 
the former F1 on the Main Menu, "Convert Keplerian Data to 2-Line Format", 
has been removed. Use the separate program MAK2LINE (available from my RPV 
BBS) to convert raw Keplerian data.
-Removed code which caused characters to appear at the upper left of the 
screen during map display when a key not assigned to a command was pressed. 
(This was test code inadvertently left enabled.)


Version 9650 -- December 1996
-----------------------------
-This is a FEATURES UPGRADE adding "Night Vision" red screen capability, 
Location Map mode at user-specified coordinates, as well as correcting 
several minor bugs.
-With the increased availability of color laptop computers, many users are 
taking STSPLUS outside at night so that they can both watch satellites and 
continue to track using STSPLUS. Unfortunately, the bright, multi-color 
screen tends to reduce night vision adaptation. I have therefore added the 
ALT-R command (for "RED") in the Main Menu and when the map is displayed. 
When "Night Vision" is enabled with ALT-R, all colors are changed to either 
RED or LIGHT RED. Press ALT-R again to return to standard colors. ALT-R is 
only effective at the Main Menu and while the map is displayed. The "Night 
Vision" mode is NOT saved and must be re-enabled each time STSPLUS is 
executed. Users may find that temporarily disabling some screen features, 
such as rivers or location labels, may make the red screen less "cluttered" 
and easier to read.
-Set User Definable Colors (F10+F9 from the Main Menu) always uses normal 
colors even if Night Vision mode is enabled.
-At the request of several geography teachers, I have added the capability 
to specify the coordinates of the center of the orthographic map in the 
Location Map mode. To enable this feature, select the orthographic 
projection ("O" with the map displayed), then select Location Map mode 
("L"), then press the slash ("/") key. STSPLUS will request the desired map 
center coordinates. Enter the latitude and longitude in degrees (and 
optional decimal fraction) as prompted. A RED CROSSHAIR marks the map 
center. (For example, enter -17.5 and -150 to center the map near Papeete, 
Tahiti.) All of the normal zoom features (PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) are 
operational and, in addition, the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT) 
will shift the map center by the current GRID spacing in the direction 
selected. Press "L" to return to the normal Location Map centered on the 
users primary or secondary location.
-Added additional code for proper operation past 1999. Prior versions did 
not handle Rev Codes in century 2000 (0001, 0101, etc.) correctly and 
failed.
-Corrected a minor bug which caused the screen to scroll when in TARGET 
mode on the world map with statute miles selected as the units. Problem was 
an extra SPACE after "mph" near the bottom of the screen when the primary 
and target spacecraft were relatively close to each other. (Careless error, 
my apologies ...)
-Corrected a minor bug with the South Atlantic Anomaly ("SAA") color when 
the "/M" command line option is used. The SAA was still in color.
-Trapped low memory error (BASIC ERROR = 7) when attempting to execute the ŠSHELL command (F9 from the Main Menu). STSPLUS now displays an appropriate 
error message and returns to the Main Menu.
-The Night Vision feature was available as Beta Test Version 9644 which was 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 198


given limited distribution via my BBS.


Version 9643 -- October 1996
----------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE adding a feature for amateur radio tracking 
and correcting a minor bug introduced in Version 9642.
-A complementary (inverted) Azimuth/Elevation tracking feature has been 
implemented to accommodate a hardware limitation in most two-axis antenna 
drives. The most popular amateur antenna rotors provide a full 360 degrees 
of azimuth coverage but have a "stop" point that does not allow "through" 
tracking; this "stop" is usually at North or South. If the stop is 
encountered in the middle of a satellite pass, tracking must cease while 
the antenna is rotated through 360 degrees, a process that can take up to 
one minute and is a significant portion of a typical 8 to 10 minute Mir or 
Space Shuttle pass. The "stop" limitation can also be at least an 
inconvenience for other, longer passes.
-Complementary Azimuth and Elevation are calculated as follows:

     CAz = (Az + 180) MOD 360
     CEl = El - 180

-Complementary Azimuth/Elevation tracking may be enabled by using F10 from 
the Main Menu and toggling F4 until the SECOND E/A appears OR by pressing 
F10 while the map is displayed until "CEl" and "CAz" are displayed as the 
satellite coordinate labels. These special labels appear in YELLOW rather 
than the usual cyan in order to alert the user.
-A minor bug related to the change in coprocessor detection was discovered 
in Version 9642 by Mike Goen at White Sands, NM. When a shuttle was tracked 
prior to launch with launch time and date enabled, secondary satellites did 
not display the square symbol but only the single position pixel. The 
problem has been corrected. Thanks, Mike!


Version 9642 -- October 1996
----------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE RELEASE correcting an annoying bug with Windows NT 
and updating the state vector output data formats to regain compatibility 
with Ken Ernandes' VEC2TLE along with several other relatively minor 
changes.
-WinNT/Win95 threaten to converge and take over the PC world. After some 
months, I finally located the clock problem for Windows NT and removed the 
call to system hardware (to check on processor type and the presence of a 
math coprocessor). This call was causing the STSPLUS local clock (either 
UTC or local time depending upon the setup) to always start at 00:00:00 in 
Windows NT. Other operating systems were not affected. Instead, I now use a 
simple BIOS equipment call (INT 11H) to determine the presence or absence 
of the math coprocessor, a call which occasionally yielded incorrect 
information on older computers. Unfortunately, the BIOS call does NOT 
identify the processor type, so that information is lost to STSPLUS for 
good. Special thanks to Paul Gabriel for providing the crucial clue to 
solving this annoying problem for WinNT users!Š-By popular request, pressing the "R" key while the map is displayed will 
now command an immediate redraw of the map. This avoids returning to the 
Main Menu just to update the map.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 199


-In order to use units more easily understood by non-technical users, I 
changed the units of relative velocity for the TARGET satellite when 
statute miles ("sm") are selected from statute miles per second or feet per 
second to statute miles per hour ("mph"). Press F9 while the map is 
displayed to select desired units of measure.
-In order to regain compatibility with Ken Ernandes' VEC2TLE which seems to 
have been lost some versions back, apparently, I have modified the Data 
Output format for Data Modes 4, 14, 24, 7, 17, and 27 (labeled data, 
equivalent to VEC2TLE's .VIF format) to add an initial data line to each 
state vector labeled "Vector format" as shown in the following example:

Note that the "plain language" date has been changed from "mm/dd/yyyy" to 
"dd MMM yyyy" for clarity. The two changes are marked with "<===" in the 
example. Each state vector is followed by a blank line for clarity. The 
example above is for Data Mode 7; the same changes have been made for Data 
Modes 4, 14, 24, 17 and 27.
-When evaluating TARGET relative range and velocity, users should note that 
during rendezvous operations the orbits of the two satellites may NOT be 
closely synchronized and the approaching satellite's orbit will often have 
a significant eccentricity. This can make the range and relative velocity 
increase and decrease over a large range of values! Velocity in particular 
can have both positive and negative values as the range increases and 
decreases during the course of an orbit.
-Corrected a minor bug which prevented Target Relative Velocity from being 
displayed when using the Motion Map.


Version 9637 -- September 1996
------------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE to correct a problem with certain COUNTRY 
CODES outside the United States.
-Version 9635 locked up when drawing the orthographic map because of a 
problem interpreting the NORAD-style date ("yyddd.dddddd") when the COUNTRY ŠCODE substituted a comma (",") for the US-style period (".") for the 
decimal point. The problem has been corrected and the appropriate decimal 
point will now be displayed in the NORAD-style date at the upper right of 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 200


the data portion of the orthographic display.
-No other changes were made in either program code or documentation.


Version 9635 -- August 1996
---------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE, incorporating several minor improvements.
-STSPLUS passed its 5th birthday in August, 1996! For those who have asked, 
I will continue to support and enhance STSPLUS as a DOS-based program at 
least through the balance of 1996. A Win95/WinNT version, if that ever 
happens, likely will not appear prior to 1997; the conversion to Windows 
requires a complete rewrite of the program and documentation, currently 
some 2MB of code and text. Even if a Windows version does appear, I will
continue to support the DOS version for some years.
-Changed the code which reads TLEs to automatically skip blank lines. The 
code was updated both for primary satellite input (filename plus satellite 
name) and for TLE updates (filename plus "&"). Several users reported 
problems with TLE files obtained from the Internet which were double 
spaced; this modification allows the direct use of files with multiple 
interspersed blank lines throughout the TLE file.
-Improved detection of non-DOS TLE files for automatic conversion to DOS 
line termination format. STSPLUS now detects CR-CR and LF-LF and forces 
conversion in those cases, as well as using a more robust algorithm to 
detect standard UNIX and MAC formats.
-Added code so that F3 (Pass Predictions) from the Main Menu may be used 
without first displaying the satellite on the map.
-Corrected the "NORAD-style" date display ("yyddd.dddddd") for correct 
operation at year 2000 and beyond. The format for years beyond 1999 is 
"00001.123456" (for 01 January 2000) where the year portion is the last two 
digits of the 4-digit year. The new format will be valid through the year 
2049. Years 50 through 99 assume century 19 and years 00 through 49 assume 
century 20. (Since I would be 114 years old in 2050, someone else can worry 
about 2050 and beyond!)
-Added statute miles ("sm") to Perigee and Apogee calculated values 
displayed with ALT-F1 from the Main Menu. As displayed, Perigee and Apogee 
are GEOCENTRIC values. All orbital data are calculated at the Epoch of the 
TLEs.
-Repaired islands in Northern Canada (again) for proper color in 
orthographic projection. Hopefully I got it right this time ...
-Added "SAA" label to South Atlantic Anomaly.
-Updated internal NASA/DOD Tracking Station list per Dave Simonson, DOD C-
Band Radar Network. The external Tracking Station file, STSPLUS.TRK, has 
also been updated.
-Corrected ascent profile to start at typical Pad 39 elevation. Prior 
versions showed actual pad elevation prior to launch then reverted briefly 
to zero at launch.
-Automatic map redraw interval prior to shuttle launch has been increased 
from 15 minutes to 30 minutes.


Version 9615 -- April 1996
--------------------------Š-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE, incorporating several significant 
enhancements and repairing several minor bugs. 
-In response to several inquiries, processing times for STSPLUS have 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 201


increased for current versions due to improved accuracy and complexity, as 
well as added features. These improvements have been implemented, in part, 
because of the much greater processing power and speed of current systems. 
Delays will be more apparent on older systems with 386 and slower 486 
processors.

                         ** IMPORTANT NOTE **

     Users are reminded that for most DOS and Windows 3.1 
     systems, a "vanilla" system (configured without a memory 
     manager) will execute MUCH faster; computation times for 
     Visible Pass Predictions, for example, are FOUR TIMES faster 
     with the "vanilla" configuration on a typical Pentium 
     system. The standard "MS-DOS Prompt" configuration for 
     Windows 95 does not include a memory manager and will 
     execute at high speed.

-With widespread availability of TLEs on the Internet, many users are now 
receiving TLEs via these sources. Unfortunately, many Internet systems use 
UNIX servers and the TLE files are often reformatted with LF-only line 
termination which causes most DOS programs to fail. STSPLUS has now been 
modified to test TLE files and, if UNIX or MAC format is detected, to 
automatically convert the file to DOS format. During file processing (F2 
from the Main Menu), the following message is displayed while this 
conversion is being performed:

     UNIX.TLE is in UNIX/MAC format and is being converted!

     Please wait ...

The original UNIX/MAC file ("UNIX.TLE" in the example above) is replaced by 
the new DOS file and the original file is deleted. Normal operation of 
STSPLUS then resumes.
-The Visible Pass Prediction code has been optimized for speed. Calculation 
times have been improved by 20% to 30% and time resolution has been 
slightly decreased. Minor differences in data may be observed when compared 
to prior versions.
-Prompted by the re-entry of the Chinese spy satellite (#22870) in early 
March of 1996, I have changed the code used to detect possible orbital 
decay. STSPLUS now calculates the perigee at Epoch and displays a warning 
message if the perigee is less than 75 nautical miles. The user may press 
ENTER to return to the Main Menu or may press ESC to proceed with orbital 
calculations. Once a satellite's orbital altitude decays to below about 70 
nautical miles (130 kilometers), re-entry may have occurred or will occur 
very soon thereafter. NOTE: The calculations may fail with a BASIC Error if 
the satellite has already decayed.
-Added data for Perigee and Apogee to that shown using ALT-F1 from the Main 
Menu. Data are calculated using the orbital data as of Epoch. Also repaired 
a BASIC Error when using this feature when a launch date and time had not 
been specified for the satellite.
-Corrected a bug with the Duration of Line-of-Sight passes when the Minimum 
Horizon angle was set to zero degrees. STSPLUS generated inaccurate times, Šsometimes by tens of hours. Thanks to Josh Willims for spotting the bug!
-In order to display a "reasonable" South Atlantic Anomaly when the Space 
Shuttle is on the launch pad and during ascent phase, the SAA is forced to 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 202


use a minimum altitude of 75 nautical miles.
-Yet another COUNTRY CODE bug has surfaced, this time in file STSPLUS.OBS 
which is written by STSPLUS for use by Kelso's program TRAKSTAR. In this 
case, the decimal point in local latitude and longitude were automatically 
replaced by commas (in spite of a FORMAT statement that explicitly used the 
period!), causing TRAKSTAR to fail. The code has been rewritten. Thanks to 
Arve Fager in Sweden for reporting the problem!
-Modified automatic map redrawing in rectangular projections so that the 
map will not be redrawn when AUTO REDRAW is enabled ("A" displayed at upper 
right, press TAB key with map displayed to enable/disable AUTO MAP REDRAW) 
until the current map has been displayed for at least 90 seconds. Thanks to 
Les Putnam for the reminders on this annoying bug!
-Added local station latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees), and elevation 
(meters) to Pass Prediction data output header section.
-Some lakes and rivers still slipped through in the orthographic projection 
when RIVERS were disabled. Thanks to Ed Toomey for spotting them!
-Various minor cosmetic changes.
-A pre-release of this update, Version 9614, included most changes EXCEPT 
the automatic conversion of TLE files to DOS format.


Version 9610 -- March 1996
--------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE, correcting several minor bugs and one major 
problem primarily affecting users outside the United States.
-For users with non-US COUNTRY CODE, corrected a problem with Pass 
Predictions (F3 from the Main Menu) which caused a BASIC Error when the 
output was sent anywhere except the screen. Pass Prediction data sent to 
file STSPLUS.LOG or LPT1/COM1/COM2 now no longer includes the day of the 
week in the header but does include the local time zone. The problem was 
related to a non-US COUNTRY CODE, a remnant of an earlier COUNTRY CODE 
problem which I thought I had eliminated. Thanks to Arve Fager at Volvo in 
Sweden for providing the necessary clue!
-Added the next date and time at which pass predictions will be tested to 
the elapsed time calculation:

     Elapsed time =  27.1 seconds, Next test at 05 MAR 96  06:40:26

Several users complained that for visible passes when no passes were found, 
they lost track of the date; I found I had the same problem and fixed it.
-Corrected a minor problem which prevented display of the South Atlantic 
Anomaly when attempting to automatically upgrade from Version 9602 or 
earlier using an old STSPLUS.INI file. Although the menu item (F10+F3+F7) 
would switch from ON to OFF and back to ON, the SAA would never be drawn 
because the color inadvertently was set to the color BLACK. (If the SAA 
color was manually set or the file STSPLUS.INI from the Version 9607 
release was used, the SAA would be drawn correctly.)
-Corrected a minor bug which caused several rivers in northern Russia to be 
displayed on the World Map. (Rivers are always disabled for the full world 
in the rectangular projection to avoid cluttering the screen.)
-Added the Target Satellite Label to the data block for range and velocity 
calculations. The label used is the label entered when setting up the ŠTarget Satellite using F6+F1 from the Main Menu. Thanks to Ridge Tolbert!
-Added preliminary usage notes for Windows 95 and Windows NT to this 
documentation.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 203


-In response to several complaints from LCD laptop users about "invisible 
text", I have adjusted the colors used for filename lists and one prompt 
for F2 and F6+F2/F3 from the Main Menu. Comments invited ...
-Various minor cosmetic changes.


Version 9607 -- February 1996
-----------------------------

     IN MEMORIAM

     This release of STSORBIT PLUS is dedicated to the memory of 
     my good friend Joel Runes who passed away unexpectedly on 
     January 11, 1996, hours after covering the launch of STS-72 
     for radio station WMEL in Melbourne, Florida. A true expert 
     in the space field, Joel's many contributions to STSORBIT 
     PLUS and to the RPV Astronomy BBS, along with all his other 
     activities far and wide, will be greatly missed by his 
     friends around the world.

-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE to enhance several features and correct 
various minor bugs.
-CAUTION: In order to accommodate new and planned features, the structure 
of file STSPLUS.INI has been changed. This means that while you may upgrade 
from a prior version without difficulty, you MUST delete file STSPLUS.INI 
IF YOU RETURN TO AN OLDER VERSION! As a precaution or if you plan to return 
to an older version, save the old STSPLUS.INI file for later use.
-In response to many user requests, I have rewritten the Pass Prediction 
code (F3 from the Main Menu) to add Line-of-Sight and Visible passes, both 
with settable minimum pass altitude (maximum pass elevation above the 
horizon) and minimum horizon threshold (minimum elevation above the 
horizon). The times and other data for Line-of-Sight and Visible passes now 
take into account the visibility and horizon criteria, as appropriate, 
eliminating all passes which do not meet those criteria. The "All Passes" 
mode is essentially identical to the pass prediction feature in prior 
versions. Note that users with slow computers and especially those without 
a math coprocessor may find that calculation times are painfully slow!
-Corrected a long-standing cosmetic bug [thanks for the reminders on this 
bug from Don Nicholson] which caused certain islands in the north of Canada 
to display as lakes. Lakes and rivers are still disabled in the full world 
rectangular projection, as before, so as to avoid unnecessarily cluttering 
the display. In this process, the four map database index files were also 
found to have errors which have been corrected and are included with this 
update:

     EARTH4.MCX
     EARTH3.MCX
     EARTH2.MCX
     EARTH1.MCX

                               *************
                               ** CAUTION **Š                               *************

     Users MUST replace ALL their existing EARTH*.MCX files with the 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 204


     new versions supplied with this update or unpredictable results 
     may occur when drawing the maps. Users who do not use the higher 
     detail map database files (EARTH3 through EARTH1) may discard the 
     unneeded files, retaining only those which correspond to the map 
     database files present on their system. The corresponding map 
     vector files, EARTH*.MCP and EARTH*.XYZ, have not been changed 
     from prior releases.

-After years of procrastination, I have finally modeled the South Atlantic 
Anomaly zone (SAA) using NASA Mission Maps, unfortunately now long out of 
print, for spacecraft altitudes from 140 nm to 330 nm. The current SAA 
model corresponds to the SAA as shown on the NASA Mission Maps for 140 nm 
and 330 nm with non-linear interpolation used at intermediate altitudes; 
the accuracy of the model used is unknown for altitudes greater than 330 nm 
although the SAA is drawn for altitudes up to 1000 nm. The SAA is disabled 
for satellite altitudes above 1000 nm. In this process, I have coded both 
the rectangular projection (shown as a simple ellipse in prior versions) 
and the orthographic projection (which was disabled in prior versions). The 
SAA data is contained in file STSPLUS.SAA which must be present in the 
default directory. Users are cautioned NOT to alter file STSPLUS.SAA or 
results may be unpredictable.
-The color used to draw the South Atlantic Anomaly has been added to the 
User-Definable Map Colors using F10+F9 from the Main Menu. The default 
color is white as in prior versions.
-Corrected a minor bug which sometimes caused the Orbit Number in the 
Descending Node Display (F10+F5 from the Main Menu) to be one high.
-Modified the Ascending/Descending Node data display (F10+F5 from the Main 
Menu) so that it is now active in both rectangular and orthographic 
projections including the Motion Map. In prior versions it was only active 
in rectangular projection. Repaired a number of minor cosmetic bugs related 
to this feature.
-Improved a minor cosmetic bug that caused stray terminator pixels to 
occasionally be left behind, usually at the southern-most or northern-most 
points of the terminator. The bug was a subtle timing problem related to 
when the Sun's position was calculated. The changes reduce but do not 
completely eliminate the problem. Completely eliminating the problem IS 
possible but would substantially slow map update times by requiring that 
the solar terminator be completely redrawn every ten seconds. In view of 
the relatively few complaints, I have elected to make a partial fix which 
reduces the incidence of the problem and does not materially affect the map 
update times.
-Repaired a minor cosmetic bug that re-used old saved pixels behind the 
satellite icon when the map was redrawn and the pixels should have been 
discarded. This caused stray ground track and map features to appear at the 
prior location of the satellite each time the map display was redrawn. The 
problem was most apparent at higher zoom factors.
-I have increased the minimum donation for program registration from 
US$10.00 to US$15.00. My costs and the time required have increased 
steadily since I first offered my software for US$10.00 in the late 1980s. 
I have also added US$5.00 for foreign air mail postage to help cover the 
additional costs and handling. I still think it's one of the best software 
bargains around ...Š-Beta Test Version 9604X was released on a limited basis in January 1996 
and included some but not all of the features of this release.

Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 205



Version 9548 -- November 1995
-----------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE only, correcting a serious bug with systems 
NOT equipped with a math coprocessor (386SX and 486SX).
-This release corrects a "BASIC Error = 11" which has troubled certain 
users with 386SX and 486SX processors and NO math coprocessor. Another bug, 
"BASIC Error = 6", could also occur and was corrected for the same 
processors.
-Corrected a problem with F2 from the Main Menu which caused errors if a 
non-existent filename was entered.
-Released and then withdrew Version 9547X, a Beta Test Version, which did 
NOT cure the math coprocessor problem. Users with Version 9547X should 
discard that version.


Version 9542 -- October 1995
----------------------------
-This is a MINOR UPDATE which includes all changes from Version 9541 (a 
Beta Test Version with limited distribution) and a few additional items. 
This will be the final update in this (seemingly endless) sequence which 
began with Version 9537. My apologies for the bugs and the inconvenience!
-The Orbit Number algorithm used during the ascent phase has been further 
refined to yield a more consistent result. The discontinuity observed at 
T+40 minutes has been substantially reduced for the examples tested.
-Added the section "Using STSPLUS on a Local Area Network (LAN)". This 
section documents a new feature which allows a Network Manager to configure 
STSPLUS for "read-only" operation from a network server. File STSPLUS.INI 
is not updated in this mode and therefore the program always begins with 
the same location, time zone, satellite, etc. In all other respects the 
"read-only" mode is identical to normal operation of the program. See the 
text for additional information.
-Updated documentation as described for Version 9541 (below) has been 
released. Except for the new section, the changes are relatively minor, 
mostly involving typographical errors and minor technical corrections.


Version 9541 -- October 1995
----------------------------
-This is a BETA TEST VERSION, primarily correcting a problem with satellite 
selection using F2 from the Main Menu.
-Repeated selection of a new primary satellite using F2 from the Main Menu 
would yield an incorrect orbital period ("Per'd") and would occasionally 
cause "BASIC Error = 11". Thanks to an inadvertent error, re-initialization 
of the SGP4 orbital model was being skipped when the satellite was changed. 
Thanks to Les Putnam of GSFC for his careful and persistent analysis in 
helping me to locate and repair the problem!
-Corrected a problem with the orbit number during the 40 minute launch 
simulation which caused the number to decrement rather than increment. The 
orbit number is still an approximation and there may be a discontinuity at 
the 40 minute mark.
-Not documented in Version 9540 was a change in the method used to initally Šread TLEs for the current mission. Prior versions always read the external 
TLE file and, for large TLE files, that could take some time. Since the 
current mission's TLEs are also stored in file STSPLUS.INI (which is always 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 206


read at startup), I changed the code so that the INI file is used at 
startup and an external file is only read with F2 from the Main Menu. This 
also protected against a missing external TLE file. Seemed like a good idea 
at the time but overlooked the fact that some users use a standard filename 
(like TLEALL.TXT, etc.) for their TLEs. I'm looking at the options ...
-Added code to reduce disk reads searching for special satellite icons each 
time the map is redrawn.
-After years of "quick fixes", too many typographical and minor technical 
errors had crept into this documentation. Special thanks to Josef Segur for 
his extensive proof-reading and suggested corrections! In addition to 
Josef's corrections, a complete spell check, the first in too many years, 
revealed quite a few more typos. The corrected documentation will be 
included in the next full release.


Version 9540 -- September 1995
------------------------------
-This is a MINOR UPDATE, correcting what are hopefully the last minor bugs 
introduced with the recent releases (9537 through 9539).
-Corrected a bug which caused the Inclination to appear as 0.000000 after 
using F2 to update TLEs. Thanks to Ray Grace for the report!
-Corrected a bug which caused the screen to scroll in rectangular 
projection when statute miles were the unit of measure and XYZ coordinates 
were displayed. Thanks to John Szalay for the report!
-Corrected a cosmetic bug which caused the Time Since Epoch ("T+Epoch"), 
which was increased by one digit to the left to accommodate up to 99999 
days, to erase the last letter of "Epoch" in rectangular projection.


Version 9539 -- September 1995
------------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE, correcting a number of problems which were 
detected in Versions 9537 and 9538. As sometimes happens, incorporating new 
or changed features introduces bugs which aren't found during initial 
testing. My apologies and thanks to everyone who reported the problems.
-A number of problems were found which resulted in a corrupt initialization 
file (STSPLUS.INI). Some problems were traced to program bugs and some to 
problems with TLE files. Every effort has been made to eliminate the 
internal bugs and to improve "bullet proofing" for TLE files. However, 
users are reminded that STSPLUS assumes that the TLE files are free from 
major structural errors and do not include plain text. Use my program 
ORBITEL or an ASCII editor to check TLE files prior to use with STSPLUS. 
TLE files obtained from my RPV Astronomy BBS have been checked.
-After too many attempts, I finally was able to get Windows 95 running on 
one of my test systems. (My primary test system was unable to run Win95!) 
Initial tests indicate STSPLUS performs adequately, although not as fast as 
under DOS 6.2. However, users should operate STSPLUS in a full window!


Version 9538 -- September 1995
------------------------------
-This is a MINOR UPDATE, adding minor enhancements, correcting several Šminor bugs, and adding setup features.
-Several users have reported a problem with Version 9537 which causes the 
program NOT to return to the Main Menu from the map when ENTER is pressed. 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 207


This is apparently caused by file STSPLUS.INI becoming corrupt. However, I 
have been unable to duplicate the problem. As a workaround, copy a good 
version of file STSPLUS.INI (the distribution version of STSPLUS.INI, for 
example) to another file named STSPLUS.OK. Then, if you must reboot your 
computer to exit STSPLUS, execute the following DOS command before again 
running STSPLUS:

     COPY STSPLUS.OK STSPLUS.INI

-STSPLUS now requests the first time user to set certain features before 
the program starts normal operation. This setup feature is automatically 
selected when the distribution version of file STSPLUS.INI is used and may 
be requested at any time by including the "/NEW" command line option when 
the program is started:

     STSPLUS /NEW

This feature requests the user to select the location, allows STSPLUS to 
calculate an estimated UTCOffset so the user may select the correct UTC 
Offset (below), and displays the current files and paths for user approval. 
A new text section, INITIAL STSPLUS SETUP, describes this feature in more 
detail.
-When the "/NEW" command line option is used (and when the distribution 
version of file STSPLUS.INI is used), STSPLUS now calculates an estimated 
UTCOffset based upon Primary Location longitude. Since the estimate does 
not take into account the political "adjustments" made to time zones, it 
may be off by one hour. Users whose time zone is set to other than the 
exact hour must enter the correct UTCOffset. (Prior versions simply 
displayed "(not set)" when the UTCOffset had not been set.)
-Corrected a minor bug which caused the Time Zone Abbreviation not to be 
set when first initializing the program.
-Added Latitude, Longitude and Elevation data for all locations when 
setting local coordinates (F10+F2). Example:

     Current PRIMARY Location:      Palos Verdes, CA
                                    Latitude:     33.7632 degrees
                                    Longitude:  -118.4057 degrees
                                    Elevation:   186      meters

-Added backspace processing for SCF filename entry, F6+F2 and F6+F3 from 
the Main Menu. All characters in the SCF filename are now capitalized, even 
if entered in lower case. Thanks to Russ Nelson for the "catch"!
-I have added ALT-F1 to the Main Menu to display the primary satellite's 
orbital data along with various times of interest. The command is NOT 
displayed on the Main Menu! (This is experimental ONLY ... comments 
invited.)
-Corrected a cosmetic problem with node data and "/CLK" command line option 
in rectangular projection. The node data now appears within the box.
-Modified large digit MET with the "/CLK" command line option in 
rectangular projection to show full MET with up to 5 digits of days.
-Added file VBERRORS.TXT to the distribution package. This file lists the 
Visual Basic for DOS errors which can terminate STSPLUS (extracted from ŠMicrosoft documentation).


Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 208


Version 9537 -- September 1995
------------------------------
-This is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE, adding several enhancements, correcting 
several relatively minor bugs, and various cosmetic changes.
-By popular request, the current Satellite Configuration File (SCF) 
filename is now saved in file STSPLUS.INI. Pressing ENTER when using either 
SCF Save (F6+F2) or SCF Read (F6+F3) will now select the current SCF 
filename. Use ESC to quit without reading/saving the SCF file. See text 
for additional details.
-NOTE: Users upgrading from a prior version (Version 9517 or older) and 
using their old .INI file must save the current satellite configuration 
(F6+F2) using the appropriate filename before the correct filename will be 
saved; the default SCF filename is otherwise set to STSPLUS.SCF.
-Various code and cosmetic changes have been made to the Satellite 
Configuration section (F6 from the Main Menu) to improve performance and 
error checking. One significant change is that STSPLUS will no longer 
attempt to process the skeletal TLEs generated when a new satellite is 
added to the SCF list; the satellite will be skipped with no message until 
real TLEs are present.
-In response to many questions, I have added STATUTE MILES for all distance 
calculations. Use F9 while the map is displayed to switch between 
kilometers (km), nautical miles (nm), and statute miles (sm). Prior 
versions of STSPLUS only calculated distances in kilometers and nautical 
miles. NASA has contributed to the "confusion" by using STATUTE MILES in 
most public statements (especially for orbital altitude) while using 
NAUTICAL MILES internally.
-Added additional information to file STSPLUS.LOG for Pass Predictions (F3 
from the Main Menu, Data Mode = 9) so that data may be more readily 
identified at a later time. The additional information is:

     Location:          Palos Verdes, CA
     Prepared:          Saturday, 09 Sep 1995  17:02:42

     Satellite Name:    STS-69
     Catalog Number:    23667  95048A  
     TLE Filename:      STS69R04.TXT

Where: "Location" is the current primary location; "Prepared" is the 
(computer) date and time of preparation; "Satellite Name" is the common 
name of the satellite; "Catalog Number" is the NORAD Number followed by the 
International Designation of the satellite; and, "TLE Filename" is the name 
of the 2-line elements file used.
-File STSMIR.ICN, now included with the distribution package, provides an
icon of the Space Shuttle docked on the Mir Space Station. See file 
STSMIR.NOT for instructions on using the icon during upcoming rendezvous 
missions. The icon was first prepared for the STS-71 mission.
-Corrected a minor bug which required the 2-line elements file to be read 
when resuming a prior mission (the command line option "/R" is included). 
STSPLUS now reads the INI file for the TLEs when resuming a prior mission. 
This modification also eliminates occasional TLE problems when selecting a 
new Primary Satellite from the list of Secondary Satellites (F6+F4 from the 
Main Menu); the LTD and XRF files are now checked when a new Primary ŠSatellite is selected.
-Corrected a problem with the "ZOE" (Zone of Exclusion) label when other 
than TDRS-East and TDRS-West are used as the communications satellites in 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 209


secondary satellite slots 1 and 2. The location of the label was hard-coded 
for the TDRS satellites. The location (longitude) of the "ZOE" label is now 
calculated dynamically and will appear in the correct location for other 
communications satellite configurations such as the two Russian ALTAIR 
satellites #20391 (Cosmos 2054/ALTAIR-1) and #23426 (Luch/ALTAIR-2) being 
used for communications with the MIR spacecraft.
-Corrected a minor bug which caused only four digits of MET days to be 
displayed. Older satellites, such as Vangard 1 (NORAD #00005) have MET 
greater than 9999 days. Note that the large MET display in the orthographic 
display always displays MET MOD 10000 because of space limitations.
-Corrected a long standing bug which sometimes caused the "BASIC Error = 
76" (path error) message and returned the user to DOS when attempting to 
execute TRAKSTAR (F4 from the Main Menu). The initial default path was 
missing a trailing backslash ("\") unless the path was manually entered. 
Thanks to James Gundrey and others for continuing to report the error until 
I finally spotted the cause!
-Modified the AOS/LOS algorithm which caused the AOS/LOS times to be 
slightly processor dependent. The variation among various processors (386, 
486 and Pentium) was usually on the order of plus or minus five seconds. 
There may still be small differences (several seconds) between very fast 
and very slow processors and systems with and without a math coprocessor 
due to a simpler and slightly less accurate algorithm when the coprocessor 
is absent (to minimize calculation times).
-Corrected a bug which caused the local time zone abbreviation to be blank 
after changing the status of the Daylight Flag (F8+F10). In prior versions 
the user had to exit STSPLUS and restart the program before the local time 
zone abbreviation was correct.
-Replaced the three lines labeled "Launch Year", "Launch Number", and 
"Launch Piece" with the single line "Int'l Designation" in the display for 
data approval when reading new TLEs from a file (F2 from Main Menu). Also, 
the 2nd Derivative of the Mean Motion (dx/dt2) has been added.
-The use of a RAM disk has been deleted from the suggested system setup 
instructions. Although a RAM disk is still an effective technique 
(especially with a "vanilla" setup), use of disk read caching with 
Microsoft's SMARTDRV or an equivalent disk caching program is now 
recommended as a more general solution applicable to many applications. 
(Disk write caching is NOT recommended; loss of power with write caching 
enabled can result in inadvertent data loss.)


Version 9517 -- April 1995
--------------------------
-This is a MAJOR UPGRADE, adding several important new features and 
enhancements. User feedback and requests have been a key factor in the 
choice of those features to add. My thanks to everyone who has taken the 
time to offer suggestions and submit bug reports. This version has been 
preceded by a number of Beta Test Versions which have been of great help in 
working out the bugs. Among the new features are: visible Pass Predictions, 
Launch Simulation for the Space Shuttle, and new Sun and satellite icons.
-Several sections of the documentation have been added or materially 
revised to reflect the new features and changes documented below.
-Added VISIBLE Pass Predictions so that users may now see at a glance when Špotential viewing opportunities are in the offing. Visibility conditions 
are tested at AOS, MAX altitude, and LOS. The feature is automatic with 
line-of-sight Pass Predictions (F3 from the Main Menu, Function 9, with Sun 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 210


features ENABLED). This has been one of the most frequently asked for 
enhancements to STSPLUS! This feature is still somewhat experimental, and 
comments are invited!
-Changed the displayed date format in Pass Predictions from "04/24/1995" to 
"24 APR 95" to avoid confusion with various date formats and to allow two 
extra columns for the "V" (visibility) flag. The new format is "dd MMM yy" 
where "dd" is the current day of the month, "MMM" is the alphabetic 
abbreviation for the month, and "yy" is the last two digits of the year.
-Added Launch Simulation (for Space Shuttle launches ONLY), enabled when 
entering launch time and date using F5 from the Main Menu. See the section 
"Launch Simulation for the Space Shuttle" for details. Thanks to Willie 
Musty of Rockwell Mission Support for providing ascent data, as well as to 
Ken Ernandes, Paul Traufler, and Dave Simonson for their assistance.
-Changed the Sun icon to filled -- for the second time. Hopefully, this 
time will prove error-free! Thanks to Russ Nelson and Don Nicholson for 
keeping after me on this enhancement.
-Corrected the coordinates for Cape Canaveral (from several miles offshore 
to onshore) in files STSPLUS.CTY and STSPLUS.LOC. Added coordinates for 
Launch Pads 39A and 39B at Cape Canaveral to file STSPLUS.LOC and 
internally; because of their close proximity to Cape Canaveral, the two 
launch pads are unlabeled and appear at MAG=2000 or greater in orthographic 
projection only. Launch pad coordinate data courtesy Dave Simonson, DOD C-
Band Radar Network.
-After numerous requests for special and/or different satellite icons, I 
have rewritten the code to use three default icons in two different sizes. 
The three icon shapes are: Space Shuttle (used whenever the satellite name 
begins with "STS"); MIR Space Station (used with NORAD Number 16609 only); 
and, Hubble Space Telescope (default selection). The icon size may be 
selected using "Set Display Features", F10+F3+F1. The default icon size is 
15x15 pixels, approximately the same size as the satellite icons in prior 
versions. The larger 21x21 pixel icon size is more easily seen when the 
program is converted to NTSC or PAL television format. The command line 
option "/21" may also be used when the program is executed to force the 
icon size to 21x21 pixels. As usual, however, there is no free lunch; these 
new icons take less code but slightly more time to draw and erase. 

     *** SPECIAL NOTE *** 

     Users who register or re-register STSPLUS Version 9517 and higher will 
     receive a copy of STSICON, the custom icon drawing program used to 
     create and modify STSPLUS icons. STSICON is ONLY available with 
     registration, see file README.

-As a companion feature to the new satellite icon code, STSPLUS will now 
search for a file "#nnnnn.ICN" (where "nnnnn" is the satellite NORAD 
Number) to use as the icon data for that specific satellite in place of the 
internal icons. These "#nnnnn.ICN" files are produced by program STSICON 
and are limited to a maximum size of 21x21 pixels.
-Corrected BASIC ERROR = 5 in Version 9515 when satellite icon moved 
offscreen in full world rectangular projection (Auto-Redraw OFF).
-Function Key F6 for Display Features (F10+F3+F6) now controls the local 
and satellite circles of visibility. Successive keypresses cycle through ŠOFF, LCL, SAT, and BOTH. (The local circle(s) of visibility were assigned 
to Function Key F1 in prior versions.)
-By request, increased the maximum number of Tracking Stations permitted in 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 211


".TRK" files from 25 to 50. For the convenience of users making their own 
Tracking Station files, the format for ".TRK" files is now included in the 
main documentation and below:

     "Maui, Hawaii",-156.7,20.9,396,"HAW"
      ------+-----  ---+-- --+- -+-  -+-
            |          |     |   |    |
            |          |     |   |    +---  Three-letter Abbreviation
            |          |     |   |
            |          |     |   +--------  Elevation in meters
            |          |     |
            |          |     +------------  Latitude in degrees
            |          |
            |          +------------------  Longitude in degrees
            |
            +-----------------------------  Station Name  

Note: Station Names are limited to 20 characters and Station Abbreviations 
are limited to 3 characters.
-Users may now select as the user location any of the tracking stations in 
the tracking station file (default file is STSPLUS.TRK) using F10+F2+F6 
from the Main Menu. This feature has been requested by several users.
-Changed the error message when reading a TLE file to correctly indicate 
the cause of an error. When TLE data is formatted incorrectly (as with TLE 
data from a UNIX system with each line terminated with LF instead of 
CR+LF as required by DOS), STSPLUS incorrectly reported "File <filename> 
not found!". The error message now reports "Data problems with file 
<filename>, check data format!". To correct UNIX formatted TLE files, use 
an ASCII editor such as the shareware program QEDIT; QEDIT will reformat 
each line with the CR+LF termination. I also have posted program TOMS.ZIP 
on my RPV Astronomy BBS which reformats UNIX text files for DOS. TLE data 
downloaded from NASA Spacelink may exhibit this data format problem.
-Repaired a bug which sometimes caused STSPLUS to fail with BASIC ERROR = 5 
when using the "/R" command line option. Whether or not the error occurred 
appears to have been data dependent and has now been resolved. (A call to 
the DOS clock was not being made with the "/R" command line option and this 
sometimes resulted in an illegal function call.) Thanks to Rudy Appel for 
reporting the problem!
-Repaired a bug which sometimes caused STSPLUS not to find the correct 
satellite in the TLE file when the "/R" command line option was used. The 
problem occurred only when the satellite was included in file STSPLUS.XRF 
and the satellite name was modified. Note that the default satellite when 
using F2 is now the satellite NORAD Number ("#16609" for MIR, for example) 
rather than an abbreviated satellite name. This change will also reduce 
problems and errors when multiple satellites have similar names like "MIR" 
and "MIR DEB" (MIR debris).
-Corrected a bug in the ZOOM feature. The PgUp and PgDn keys now operate 
correctly for zoom functions in rectangular projections. My apologies for 
not spotting this bug sooner ... I seldom use the rectangular projections 
in conjunction with Doppler data. The bug appeared when Doppler data was 
added in early 1994 (Version 9406) and only then after Doppler data was 
first enabled using F8 while the map was displayed in orthographic modes.Š-Corrected a bug that caused Doppler data to appear on rectangular maps 
if PgDn or PgUp keys were pressed when Doppler data was enabled.
-I removed the detection for Pentium chips that was present in some Beta 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 212


Test Versions. Due to a flaw in the detection algorithm, some 486DX2 and 
486DX4 chips were incorrectly detected as a Pentium. STSPLUS now simply 
indicates "486DX+" for 486 and higher chips.
-Modified the TARGET logic to show relative velocity between the Primary 
and Target satellites when the relative range is less than 10,000 km. Users 
should note that these are "line of sight" calculations and may be 
misleading if the satellites are at large relative range. (Prior versions 
limited display to low velocities and close approaches.)
-Changed date input subroutine (used with F8 from the Main Menu) to use the 
current year as the default when a partial date is entered. For example, 
the date may now be entered as "1/15" or "15.01" and the current year will 
be used. Prior versions were hard coded to a specific year. Thanks to Russ 
Nelson for the suggestion.
-Changed launch date/time input code (F5 from Main Menu) to automatically 
enable MET when data is accepted.
-Corrected a problem with Pass Predictions (Altitude and Azimuth wrong!) 
which crept into the Beta Test Versions. A position vector was not being 
initialized. Thanks to George Sells for spotting and reporting the problem!
-Corrected a data misalignment with AOS/LOS data in rectangular mode when 
"/CLK" command line option used and TDRS satellites set OFF. Thanks to Don 
Nicholson for reporting the problem (several times).
-Updated current BBS information at the end of the documentation.
-By popular request, added the Bibliography of Astronomy and Space 
Subjects, extracted from the documentation for my program ASTROCLK.


Versions 9509-9515 -- March 1995 
--------------------------------
-These releases were Beta Test Versions, not released publicly. The notes 
for the various changes made in these releases (those that survived!) have 
been incorporated in the notes for Version 9517 above without regard for 
which Beta Test Version they first appeared in.
-My thanks to all for the help, suggestions, and bug reports from those who 
exercised these versions!


Version 9445 -- November 1994
----------------------------
-Corrected a long standing problem with orbit numbering, primarily during 
space shuttle missions. STSPLUS now accepts the orbit number given in the 
TLEs and allows only a 60 second time offset prior to the next ascending 
node. In other words, if Epoch Time is within 60 seconds of the next 
ascending node, STSPLUS assumes the orbit number in the TLEs is for that 
ascending node; otherwise, STSPLUS assumes the TLE orbit number is for the 
current orbit. In prior releases, STSPLUS used the NEAREST ascending node 
in its orbit number calculations rather than the CURRENT ascending node and 
this often required adjustment to the orbit number in TLEs. Orbit numbers 
will still be correctly calculated when the Epoch Time is just after the 
ascending node; this change only applies to TLEs in the second half of an 
orbit. Thanks to Ken Ernandes for repeatedly "reminding" me to fix this 
annoying problem!
-STSPLUS may now operate with the DOS clock set to either LOCAL TIME or UTC ŠTIME. Use F8+F10 from the Main Menu to set the DOS time zone (along with 
the UTC Offset and Daylight Flag). The default assumes the computer is set 
to LOCAL time.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 213


-In response to several requests, added the capability to show AOS/LOS in 
four time units by pressing F12:

          Countdown clock in minutes:seconds (as in prior versions)
     UTC  UTC time in hours:minutes
     LCL  Local time in hours:minutes (proper abbreviations will be used)
     MET  Mission Elapsed Time in hours:minutes

All "hours:minutes" times are TRUNCATED rather than rounded to the minute, 
and days are omitted; thus, an MET of 4/01:02:00 and 4/01:02:59 will both 
display as "01:02". Time Since Epoch ("T+E") will display in place of MET 
if the MET flag is OFF. If no launch time has been set, MET AOS and LOS 
times will NOT be available. NOTE: Older computers without an F12 key 
cannot use this feature.
-In the orthographic mode, the appropriate time units label is shown for 
UTC, LCL and MET to the left of "AOS   LOS" when only one local station is 
enabled; no label is shown for normal countdown clocks OR if two local 
stations are enabled. LCL is replaced by the appropriate abbreviation if 
available for the time zone.
-In rectangular modes, space for time units labels is only available when 
the "/CLK" command line option is used AND MET is selected using F2. When 
displayed, the labels are UTC, LCL, and MET as above.
-Added internal time zone abbreviations for Hawaii (UTC-10, HST/HDT), Yukon 
(UTC-9, YST/YDT), and Atlantic (UTC-4, AST/ADT) zones.
-When entering Launch Time and Date (F5 from the Main Menu), dates are now 
displayed as "dd MMM yyyy" where "MMM" is the alphabetic abbreviation for 
the month. However, all dates must still be entered using the NUMERIC 
formats "mm/dd/yy" or "mm/dd/yyyy" (US style), or "dd.mm.yyyy" (European 
style).
-Corrected a minor bug which caused the longitude labels not to display for 
EGA and Motion Map modes in some circumstances.
-Removed the "happy face" progress indicator in the Motion Map if the 
system reports a 386/387 or higher processor. This undocumented feature was 
added for users with slow computers and computers without a math 
coprocessor so there would be some "action" as those clunkers plodded 
through the off-screen map drawing process.
-Various cosmetic repairs.

Version 9435A -- August 1994
----------------------------
-Version 9435A corrects a problem with certain country codes (such as those 
which use the "YY-MM-DD" date format) which still caused "BASIC Error = 5" 
in the orthographic mode for Version 9435. The program should now be 
independent of the country code.
-Corrected a minor bug with amateur radio satellite frequencies. If the 
primary satellite was changed with F6, the frequency file (STSPLUS.FRQ) was 
not rescanned and the frequencies from the prior satellite remained. 
STSPLUS will now always rescan file STSPLUS.FRQ if the primary satellite is 
changed.


Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 214


Version 9435 -- August 1994
---------------------------
-This release repairs an unfortunate bug which surfaced when I added the
NORAD-style date on the orthographic display. Only users who set DOS to
non-US-style date formats were affected. The problem occurred immediately 
when drawing the orthographic map as "BASIC Error = 5" and returned the 
user to DOS.
-Added satellite name cross-reference in file STSPLUS.XRF. When TLEs are 
read and accepted, STSPLUS now checks for the cross-reference file and, if 
the file is present in the current directory, checks for the NORAD Number 
of the satellite and a cross-reference name. If found, the new name is 
substituted for that found in the TLE file. The file is standard ASCII and 
each entry consists of a SPACE, the five-digit NORAD Number, a SPACE, and 
then the satellite name. A sample file:

 22920 HST Solar Array
 22076 Topex/Poseidon
 21225 Gamma Ray Observ
 20638 Rosat Observatory
 20580 Hubble Telescope
 16609 MIR Space Station

NOTE: The leading space is required for file compatibility with my program 
ORBITEL (but is optional for STSPLUS). The NORAD Number MUST be 5 digits; 
pad with leading zeroes if necessary. Only one entry is read per satellite. 
If the satellite name is longer than 19 characters, only the left 19 
characters will be used. This feature may be used to substitute any name 
for that given in a TLE file (which is not always consistent from source to 
source) or to specify a payload piggy-backed on another satellite (as is 
frequently the case with amateur radio transponders). A number of XRF files 
are posted on my RPV Astronomy BBS; such files must be renamed for use with 
STSPLUS.
-Repaired a minor bug which caused the pass predictions (F3 from Main Menu 
to repeat a pass indefinitely when that pass was a grazing pass with a 
maximum elevation of less than one degree (0.14 degrees in the test case 
reported by Ken Ernandes).
-Corrected a bug in read/save .SCF files (F6 from the Main Menu). If a 
filetype is entered (".SCF" or whatever), it is now ignored and ".SCF" is 
automatically appended to the filename. Thanks to Paul Becker for reporting 
the problem.
-In response to many requests, the date input routine has been modified to 
permit entry in the European style "dd.mm.yyyy" in addition to the US style 
"mm/dd/yyyy". The choice of delimiter ("." or "/") determines the method of 
interpretation. In both cases, the year may be entered as the last two 
digits only, "yy", if desired; "50" through "99" will be interpreted as 
"1950" through "1999" and all others as 2000+yy. Dates are displayed as "dd 
MMM yyyy" where "MMM" is the English abbreviation for the month.
-All current .SCF files are now displayed for both SAVE and READ functions 
(F6+F2 and F6+F3 from the Main Menu).
-Improved backspace processing and error checking when entering TLE 
filenames (F2 from the Main Menu).
-Corrected "West Latitude" to "West Longitude" in the data entry section Šfor local coordinates (F10+F2).
-Various minor cosmetic changes.

-Version 9434 was released as a Beta Version to selected users and included 
all changes in Version 9435 EXCEPT the repair to the NORAD-style date bug.

Version 9432A -- August 1994
----------------------------
-As too often happens, a bug was discovered in Version 9432 just after it 
was released. The elevation ("Elv") and azimuth ("Azm") in the rectangular 
projections either remained at zeroes or at the last value calculated 
during orthographic projection. There was no workaround. The problem has 
been repaired. My apologies to those who received the defective version.


Version 9432 -- July 1994
-------------------------
-Version 9432 adds several new features and corrects a number of program 
errors and/or "bugs". Several minor cosmetic changes were also made.
-Added Data Output Mode 8 to generate tabular output for Doppler Shift 
calculations for a selected pass while the tracking map is displayed. Use 
F3 from the Main Menu and select Mode 8; setup features are identical to 
other modes (output device, interval, etc.). See text for details.
-Look angle calculations [elevation ("Elv") and azimuth ("Azm")] during the 
tracking map display are more accurate thanks to an improved algorithm 
supplied by Ken Ernandes. Users should note that near culmination (maximum 
elevation) for passes near the user's zenith (approaching 90 degrees 
elevation) there is some uncertainty and ambiguity as to azimuth although 
the angular error remains very small.
-Changed "Alt" to "Elv" as the label for satellite elevation (altitude) 
above mean sea level to conform to standard satellite tracking convention.
-Because STSPLUS is used worldwide, I have reformatted all displayed dates 
throughout the program to avoid confusion of the day versus the month. For 
orthographic displays, the display now shows the current UTC date and time 
("dd MMM hh:mm:ss UTC") and then the local time ("dd mmm hh:mm:ss PDT" 
where "PDT" is replaced by the local time abbreviation). For both dates, 
the year is implied. The MET/T+E is moved up one line. A typical time 
display will show:
     15 JUL 19:57:36 UTC
     15 JUL 12:57:36 PDT
          7/03:14:36 MET
For the Main Menu and rectangular projections, the dates are all given as 
"dd MMM yyyy". Data locations are unchanged. A typical date and time will 
now be displayed as:
     15 JUL 1994  19:57:36 UTC
For all cases, "MMM" is the three letter English abbreviation for the 
month, "JAN" for January, "FEB" for February, etc.

     IMPORTANT NOTE: Keyboard entry of dates is still in the American 
     numeric format, "mm/dd/yyyy" or "mm/dd/yy".

-For orthographic projections, the current time using NORAD convention 
("yyddd.dddddd") is displayed immediately beneath the current TLE filename:
        94196.831667
This provides an immediate method to identify the current year and day-of-Šthe-year, "94" and "196" respectively in the example above.
-Added an additional data line in orthographic display to show the current 
orbital period ("Per'd" using the format "hh:mm:ss") for normal display OR, 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 216


for satellites with Eccentricity >= 0.005, satellite Phase, defined as Mean 
Anomaly normalized to the range 0-256 ("Phase" using the format "nnn.n") 
for use with the Doppler Shift mode [press F8 while the map is displayed] 
and satellites which change transponder mode based upon phase. Although 
Phase is technically defined as an integer value from 0 through 255, 
STSPLUS displays it to one decimal place to alert users to upcoming 
phase/transponder changes. Other users may also be interested in two 
important Phase or Mean Anomaly angles: Phase=0.0 (Mean Anomaly is 0 
degrees) corresponds to perigee and Phase=128.0 (Mean Anomaly is 180 
degrees) corresponds to apogee.

     NOTE: Mean Anomaly (and therefore Phase) becomes undefined for a 
     perfectly circular orbit. In practice, satellites with eccentricity 
     less than 0.005 will display some ambiguity as to Mean Anomaly and 
     Phase. Note also that the "Elv" is the geodetic elevation (altitude) 
     of the satellite above Mean Sea Level and NOT the geocentric radius of 
     the satellite's orbit, the parameter used to determine apogee and 
     perigee; the difference due to the shape of the Earth is as much as 
     21 km. See the section "Satellite Communications and Amateur Radio" 
     for additional discussion!

-Repaired the Tracking Station color feature (F10+F9) so that it operates 
correctly. Versions 9415/9414 caused the entire screen to turn light red 
when the Tracking Station color was changed due to a careless coding error.
-Rewrote the local coordinates code and text (F10+F2) to improve clarity 
and add several features. Now uses a function key menu to select action to 
perform. Press ENTER to return to prior menu. When entering new 
coordinates, an illegal latitude or longitude will cause that coordinate to 
be set to zero. Longitude may be entered as East Longitude (0 to +360) or 
West Longitude (0 to -180); the longitude is converted if necessary and 
stored in the range from -180 to 0 to +180.
-The threshold for generating the "Satellite may have decayed!" message has 
been increased to a Mean Motion of 16.4 revs/day to reduce the probability
of the message appearing during low shuttle flights.
-Added code to check for synchronization and data errors in the .INI file 
between the "short form" satellite position data and the 2-line elements. 
If the NORAD numbers do not agree, the "short form" data will be set to the 
TLE NORAD number and the remaining data reset; if TLEs are not present, 
dummy TLEs are inserted. Use F6 to verify and/or correct the secondary 
satellites, then use F2+& to update data from TLE file(s).
-Adjusted the "trigger" for automatic redraw in orthographic modes with 
higher zoom factors to compensate for high speed processors such as the 
90MHz Pentium. (Under some circumstances, redraw was being triggered 
continuously.)
-Repaired a minor bug that caused the TDRS and Sun AOS/LOS data to be 
missing on the rectangular display when Doppler Shift mode had been 
selected on the orthographic display.
-Corrected the conversion factor used to convert meters to feet. Thanks to 
Steve Lenz for reporting the bug!

-Versions 9424, 9429, and 9431 were beta test versions not released 
publicly and included some of the features and changes in this release. For ŠVersion 9424, the precision of Doppler shift frequencies was increased to 5 
digits (10 Hz) to the right of the decimal point but this proved confusing 
and has been restored to 4 digits (100 Hz).
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 217



Version 9415 -- April 1994
--------------------------
-This release repairs a problem in rectangular projections which caused the 
Alt/Az calculations to be incorrect. (The data in orthographic projections 
were alright.) The problem was traced to a duplicated variable name which 
was added to shared common. Only file STSPLUS.EXE is changed.


Version 9414 -- March 1994
--------------------------
-This is a MAJOR UPGRADE, adding new features for satellite communications 
and amateur radio, user-definable map colors for certain map features, 
improving RA/DEC coordinates, and incorporating several bug fixes.
-See also the notes below for Version 9406 (not released publicly).

ENHANCEMENTS FOR SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND AMATEUR RADIO:
------------------------------------------------------------
-By popular request and with the assistance of Ken Ernandes, N2WWD, I have 
added Doppler shift calculations for uplink and downlink frequencies. The 
calculated uplink (XMIT) and downlink (RECV) frequencies have been tested 
in full duplex with RS-10 and yield excellent results. The Doppler shift 
calculations are available in orthographic projections ONLY for this 
release. See the text for complete discussion.
-The satellite NORAD Number, UPLINK and DOWNLINK frequencies (referenced to 
the satellite), and the transponder mode are specified in file STSPLUS.FRQ 
in that order, separated by commas and without any leading or trailing 
spaces. A sample file might include:

        00000,100,100,1           (Default values if sat # not found)

        18129,145.8900,29.3900,1  (Parameters for NORAD #18129)
        --+-- ----+--- ---+--- +
          |       |       |    |
          |       |       |    +-- Transponder Mode:  1 = NORMAL
          |       |       |                          -1 = INVERTED
          |       |       |
          |       |       +------- DownLink Center Frequency (MHz)
          |       |
          |       +--------------- UpLink Center Frequency (MHz)
          |
          +----------------------- Satellite NORAD Number

The first sample line shows the "00000" entry which determines the default 
parameters if the satellite is NOT included in file STSPLUS.FRQ. This 
should be the FIRST LINE in file STSPLUS.FRQ. The second line gives real 
parameters for a specific satellite; the frequencies shown select the Mode 
A voice passband for Radio Sputnik 10 (RS-10, piggybacked on COSMOS 1861, 
NORAD #18129). The uplink and downlink frequencies should not exceed 
99000.0000 MHz to avoid an overflow condition on the display.
-File STSPLUS.FRQ may be created or edited with any ASCII editor; word 
processor users, use the "non-document" mode. Note that only minimum error Šchecking is performed and the user must observe the required format exactly 
for each line in the file.
-The Doppler shift calculations replace the TDRS and Sun AOS/LOS data in 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 218


the data block to the right of the orthographic map. To enable display of 
these frequencies, press F8 while the map is displayed; to return to the 
AOS/LOS calculations, press F8 again while the map is displayed. F8 is NOT 
active when in PAUSE mode. The following example illustrates the display as 
a satellite approaches the ground station (using 1000 MHZ for both 
frequencies to show the relative transmit and receive ratios):

        UpLink:  1000.0000    Uplink frequency received by satellite
          XMIT:   999.9761    TRANSMIT frequency at ground station
        DnLink:  1000.0000    Downlink frequency xmitted by satellite
          RECV:  1000.0239    RECEIVE frequency at ground station

The XMIT and RECV frequencies will be shown in color on EGA/VGA color 
monitors:

        RED     Satellite is below receiver's horizon
        YELLOW  Satellite is 5 degrees or less above receiver's horizon
        GREEN   Satellite is 5 degrees or more above receiver's horizon

Transmissions will not normally be possible when RED is shown. 
Transmissions MAY be possible when YELLOW is shown. Transmissions should be 
practical when GREEN is shown provided the ground station has a clear 
horizon in the direction of the satellite.
-STSPLUS includes a "fine tuning" feature for the uplink and downlink 
frequencies. While in the Doppler shift calculation mode, the following 
keys have a different function from the normal map modes:

        UP Arrow        Increase RECV frequency by 100 Hz
        DOWN Arrow      Decrease RECV frequency by 100 Hz
        PgUp            Increase RECV frequency by 1 KHz
        PgDn            Decrease RECV frequency by 1 KHz
        Home            Restore Uplink and DnLink frequencies to those
                          read in from file STSPLUS.FRQ
        End             (not used)

If the satellite transponder is NORMAL, the XMIT frequency will be 
increased or decreased by the same amount as the RECV frequency. If the 
satellite transponder is INVERTED, the amount of change in the XMIT 
frequency will be the same magnitude but in the opposite direction as the 
change to the RECV frequency.

OTHER SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS AND CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE:
--------------------------------------------------------
-In response to numerous user requests, the colors for certain map features 
are now user-definable. The assignable features are:
     Local Station circle of visibility
     Isocontour circles in Location and Tracking Station modes
     Tracking Station circles of visibility
From the Main Menu, use F10+F9 to set these colors. The new colors will be 
saved in file STSPLUS.INI for future use. To those users who want to 
change EVERYTHING, my response is: a) that's a non-trivial programming 
exercise, and b) I've spent considerable time designing the program to have Ša certain "look and feel" which I wish to retain.
- The Program Features and Options menu has been changed. Function Key F9 
is now used for User-Definable Colors (above) and not for setting the UTC 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 219


Offset and Daylight Flag. Use F8+F10 from the Main Menu to set the UTC 
Offset and Daylight Flag.
-Users are reminded that STSPLUS expects ground station coordinates 
(latitude and longitude) in the geodetic coordinate system, as commonly
used on maps (WGS-72 System). Ground station altitude (elevation above Mean 
Sea Level) is expected in METERS; if a ground station is significantly 
above Mean Sea Level, accuracy will be substantially improved if an 
accurate altitude is used. Many cities in file STSPLUS.CTY have ZERO given 
as the altitude if no altitude was available in the source(s) used for 
preparation of the file. The same comments apply to Tracking Stations in 
file STSPLUS.TRK.
-The coordinates for Right Ascension and Declination were incorrect in 
prior versions. The ground station's GEODETIC latitude instead of the 
GEOCENTRIC latitude was used in the calculations. The error was greatest 
(especially the Declination) for ground stations in mid-latitudes as a 
satellite approached local zenith. Thanks to Alan Nutley of Australia for 
putting me on the track of this one!
-Local horizon coordinates were also affected by the latitude error. The 
typical error near maximum was one or two degrees in altitude (elevation).
-The keyboard response time has been improved; except when the map is 
actually being drawn, response is immediate instead of waiting for the next 
second. In the Doppler Shift Mode, the arrow keys and PgUp and PgDn may be 
held down to repeat. During rapid key repeats, map and data updates may be 
deferred; waiting for a second will allow the map and data to be updated.
-The primary satellite's circle of visibility did not display on the World 
Map when the Motion Map (Dual-Page EGA Mode) was enabled. This has been 
corrected. Thanks to Todd Sherman for reporting the bug.
-Corrected a problem which caused BASIC ERROR 6 on restart when the SHELL 
TO DOS (F9 from the Main Menu) was used and the program was in orthographic 
projection.
-Various minor bug fixes and cosmetic changes.

-Versions 9412 and 9413 were BETA VERSIONS released on a limited basis.
-Special thanks to Ken Ernandes, N2WWD, for his assistance and testing of 
the satellite communications and amateur radio features!


Version 9406 -- February 1994
-----------------------------
-This version was for Beta Test only and was not released publicly.
-Several users have reported that file STSPLUS.INI sometimes became corrupt 
and I have (finally) found and corrected the problem. An array index was 
overrunning the bounds of the array and overwriting other data in SHARED 
COMMON. This usually only affected the data in secondary satellites but was 
potentially more dangerous. The problem also caused some dot colors on the 
ground track to be incorrect.
-When no STSPLUS.INI file is present (or when the UTCOffset is set to -99), 
the user is automatically asked to set filenames and paths.
-In response to quite a number of user requests, I have added the "/SS" 
command line option to force STSPLUS into a "screen saver" mode. In this 
mode the program displays the full orthographic globe, ground track and all 
selected map features but NO DATA at the right. Use ENTER or ESC to return Što DOS.
-New command line options have been added to control certain display 
features (especially from batch files). The new feature status is saved in 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 220


file STSPLUS.INI.
     +L   Include Location and Feature Labels
     -L   Exclude Location and Feature Labels
     +R   Include Rivers and Lakes
     -R   Exclude Rivers and Lakes
     +T   Include Tracking Stations
     -T   Exclude Tracking Stations
     +V   Include Local Circle of Visibility
     -V   Exclude Local Circle of Visibility
-Because of problems reported with word processors which add the 8th bit to 
some characters (and have been used to edit TLE files), I have added code 
to strip off the 8th bit in Line 0 of TLEs. However, this is not foolproof, 
and users are cautioned to use ONLY editors which do NOT add the 8th bit 
and which maintain the "standard" CR/LF at the end of each text line.


Version 9405 -- January 1994
----------------------------
-Version 9405 is a MAINTENANCE UPDATE, correcting a number of relatively 
minor bugs and updating the documentation to reflect changes in Versions 
9403 and 9405.
-Rewrote MET calculations to (hopefully) avoid truncation and rounding 
errors which sometimes caused MET to be one second off. The problem was 
dependent upon both launch and epoch times.
-Added default filenames and paths if UTCFlag is set to -99. (Setting 
UTCFlag to -99 may be used to distribute STSPLUS.INI files when the 
ultimate user's time zone is unknown. This procedure forces the user to set 
the UTC and DAYLIGHT values, and is NOT recommended for the novice!) 
Filenames and paths should ALWAYS be checked and set if necessary using F7 
from the Main Menu whenever upgrading to a new version.
-Improved calculation algorithm for "Calculating Orbital Data" phase of 
program initialization for satellites with mean motion less than 15 and 
greater than 2. The improvement may only be apparent on slower processors 
or systems without a math coprocessor.
-Corrected a cosmetic bug which caused the time portion of negative MET to 
appear at the left on the next line in rectangular projection modes. 
(Missing semicolon!)


Version 9403 -- January 1994
----------------------------
-In response to numerous complaints about BASIC ERROR 6 ("Overflow") when 
using Relative Target Tracking with rectangular map projection, I have 
corrected a condition while calculating relative velocity which could 
generate the overflow error. The error may be related to processor speed 
and/or specific 2-line elements and has been difficult to reproduce.
-Corrected several differences between rectangular and orthographic maps so 
that rectangular maps are processed as close as practical to the way that 
orthographic maps are processed. This eliminated some spurious data that 
was displayed momentarily as the rectangular map was first drawn and may 
also help avoid the BASIC ERROR 6 problem (above).
-Corrected a cosmetic bug which caused the "s" in "ft/s" and "m/s" to Šremain on the screen when switching coordinates from target data to other 
coordinates using F10 while the map is displayed.
-Several minor cosmetic changes.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 221




Version 9402 -- January 1994
----------------------------
-Corrected (I hope) a bug which caused BASIC ERROR = 6 when switching from 
MET to T+E while using a Target Satellite. The problem was traced to a 
variable which was not re-initialized when F5 was pressed while the map was 
displayed.
 

Version 9353 -- December 1993
-----------------------------
-Added Relative Target Tracking (not included in Beta Test Versions 9351 
and 9352) to report relative range [km or nm] and velocity [m/s or ft/s] 
between the Primary Satellite and a Target Satellite selected from among 
the Secondary Satellites. Relative Velocity data is presented ONLY if the 
Relative Range is less than 5000 km. The Target Satellite is selected with 
F6+F5 and the relative tracking data is enabled by F3+F6 from the Main Menu 
or F9 while the map is displayed. See text for details.
-The Secondary Satellite code has been modified to save a skeletal TLE when 
a new satellite is added. This permits the user to use F2+'&' to update 
TLEs INCLUDING the new satellite(s). The warning message for satellites 
without TLEs in F6 has been modified to remind users that they may either 
update the TLEs or display the satellite ground track.
-I seem to have tracked down an internal timing anomaly that caused errors 
in the tracking data of about +/-0.5 seconds. Worst case, this caused an 
error in calculated position on the order of tens of meters (about the 
length of the space shuttle!) and would not be easily detectable under most 
circumstances. Thanks to Ken Ernandes for first reporting the problem 
several months ago.
-Corrected a problem which caused the STSPLUS.INI file to become corrupt if 
Event Timers were set to OFF. Thanks to Chuck Dean for reporting the bug!
-Corrected a problem with secondary satellites and .SCF files when one or 
more secondary satellites was deleted, leaving blank satellite slots. 
Secondary satellites may now occupy any slot with or without intervening 
blank slots.
-The Primary Satellite is now labeled "Primary" and shown in YELLOW if it 
is included in the satellite configuration data (F6+F1).
-When displaying the satellite configuration data (F6+F1), the 2-line 
elements are checked for epoch. If the epoch is more than 10 days (Real 
Time) or 60 days (Static) prior to the current/simulated time, a flashing 
RED asterisk ("*") is shown next to the satellite number and a warning is 
shown at the bottom of the screen. NOTE: This is a caution warning only; 
the elements may or may not still be valid.
-Added an "OFF" mode for Secondary Satellites (F6+F1). The OFF mode permits 
one or more satellites to be disabled (not displayed) without removing the 
data from the secondary satellite data. All data are retained and the 
satellite may be re-enabled at any time. Thanks to Paul Grupp for the 
suggestion!
-Added grid labels in the orthographic displays (when Additional Grid Lines 
are enabled with F10+F3+F3) for latitude and longitude when the MAG factor 
is 500 or greater. Latitude labels are always at the left side of the map; Šlongitude labels are at the top or the bottom depending upon the map 
center. The labels are disabled for polar and near polar maps because of 
the projection.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 222


-Changed the plot update interval for secondary satellites to EVERY SECOND 
if a 386 or higher processor AND a math coprocessor are present. This 
avoids a "leapfrogging" effect between the primary and secondary satellites 
during close proximity operations. For other processor/coprocessor 
combinations, the plot update interval remains TEN SECONDS as in prior 
versions. In all cases, the ground track for secondary satellites is only 
plotted every ten seconds in order to avoid cluttering the display.
-Changed the orbit number calculation after considerable debate. The code 
used in all prior versions caused the TLE orbit number to be incremented if 
the epoch of the TLE was in the latter half of the orbit (at or past the 
descending node). The new method increments the TLE orbit number only if 
the epoch is within 0.1 orbit of the ascending node. CAUTION: This change 
may cause orbit numbers to be different if prior missions are replayed 
using TLEs which were adjusted to compensate for STSPLUS' prior orbit 
numbering conventions.
-Removed code which translated satellite names. Names beginning with "HST" 
were changed to "Hubble Space Telescope"; with the jettisoning of the "HST 
Solar Array", that debris was being renamed also. A similar problem 
occurred with MIR debris. If you wish to rename one or more satellites, use 
my program ORBITEL (available free on my BBS or for a donation of US$10.00 
by mail).
-Corrected a cosmetic bug which caused stray pixels to appear when a 
secondary satellite intersected the circle of visibility for the primary 
satellite. Thanks to Joel Runes for spotting the problem.
-Added the International Date Line in orthographic displays as a dotted 
bright blue line where it is different from the 180th meridian.
-Corrected a cosmetic bug for map drawing time in orthographic mode. If the 
operation spanned midnight, the drawing time overflowed the field with a 
number like "%-86300.12", wrapping around to the left side of the screen.
-Removed the function to disable solar features (Sun and Terminator) from 
the map using F8 while the map is displayed. The function is now available 
ONLY from the Main Menu using F10+F3+F8.
-Changed the "Additional Grid Lines" function, F10+F3+F3, to ON or OFF.
-USSPACECOM has changed the format of the 3-character "Launch Piece" 
portion of the International Designator in their 2-line elements (TLE) from 
right justified to left justified. This caused STSPLUS to show "(n/a)" for 
the launch piece. The data displayed when the elements are presented for 
user approval have been changed from numeric to the alpha designation given 
in the TLE. In other words, launch piece "B" will be so shown instead of 
"2" as in prior versions.
-All references to "IAU Designation" have been changed to "International 
Designation" or "Int'l Designation".
-Changed the limits on UTC Offset to allow +13 hours and -13 hours to 
conform to civil practice for certain areas in the South Pacific.
-Removed the "FOV" (field of view) data from the orthographic data block. 
The calculation was incorrect and misleading.
-Various cosmetic changes and improvements.

Versions 9351 and 9352 were BETA TEST VERSIONS with limited distribution. 
A number of minor bugs were reported and have been corrected for this 
release:
-Selecting a new Primary Satellite before a map was displayed sometimes Šfailed.
-Selecting a new Primary Satellite did not set MET correctly. The MET was 
calculated for the prior Primary Satellite. Thanks to David Cottle!
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 223


-Secondary satellites set to OFF were drawn (but not updated) on the 
rectangular projection.
-Corrected a cosmetic bug which caused the thousands digit of MET DAYS not 
to be erased when switching large clock times (Mag=100, VGA only) with F2. 
Similarly, the colon (":") was omitted when switching from MET to/from T+E 
using F2.


Version 9338 -- September 1993
------------------------------
-Repaired a bug in multi-satellite modes which caused a "trail of dots" to 
be left behind if the primary satellite icon fell on top of a secondary 
satellite icon (such as during close proximity operations).
-Repaired a bug when reading SCF files. In prior versions, the primary 
satellite was changed if the SCF file had a different primary satellite. 
The primary satellite in the SCF file is now ignored. The format of the SCF 
file is unchanged to maintain compatibility with prior versions.
-Modified the World and Zoom Maps in rectangular projection so that the 
PgDn key switches to Zoom Map (180 degrees) from World Map, and the PgUp 
key switches to World Map from Zoom Map (180 degrees).
-Added list of available .SCF files when reading, F6+F3 from the Main Menu.
-Added a warning when writing .SCF files if the requested file already 
exists. F6+F2 from the Main Menu. User must now press "Y" to overwrite an 
existing file, ENTER or any other key to cancel.
-By user request, modified the small character set (used for labels) to 
include the DASH ("-").
-After numerous user complaints, I've finally repaired the BLINK mode so 
that for most systems the primary satellite icon will blink on and off once 
per second. Press "B" while the map is displayed to toggle the BLINK mode.
-Repaired a minor bug which caused the message "Pause ... press ENTER" not 
to be displayed if the map was redrawn during Pause Mode.
-Thanks to the many users who took the time to carefully document these 
bugs, enabling me to find and fix them!


Version 9334 -- August 1993
---------------------------
-The maximum number of Static and Real Time satellites is increased to 32. 
This permits the entire GPS constellation, currently 25 active Block I and 
Block II satellites, to be tracked. The satellite setup display, F6+F1 from 
the Main Menu, has been modified to two display pages of 16 satellites 
each; the second page of 16 is not displayed if no active satellites are 
present.
-Added "Clear Static and Real Time Satellites", F6+F4 from the Main Menu, 
to speed reconfiguration of these satellites. It may be used to clear any 
block of satellites NOT INCLUDING #1 AND #2 (which are assigned to TDRS 
East and TDRS West and must be cleared manually). Users are cautioned that 
once cleared, the satellite data for the cleared satellites is lost. If in 
doubt, save the current satellite configuration to a SCF file using F2 
BEFORE clearing!
-Somehow the "bullseye" was lost in the Tracking Mode for rectangular 
projection several releases back. It has now returned. Thanks to Alan Pound Šfor reporting the problem!
-As an experiment, I changed the color of land boundaries from Light Cyan 
to Cyan to make multi-satellites and other display features a little easier 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 224


to spot. Feedback welcome!
-When Extra Grid Lines are OFF (F10+F3+F3), changed the color of the grid 
lines from Light Blue to Blue and added lines of latitude at +80 and -80 
degrees.
-Various repairs to eliminate spurious pixels and other minor problems 
associated with multi-satellites.


Version 9333 -- August 1993
---------------------------
-This is a MAJOR UPGRADE, adding multi-satellite capability. This is the 
first in a series of upgrades for tracking multiple satellites and 
rendezvous missions. Comments, suggestions, and bug reports are welcome!
-Special thanks to Joel Runes for his assistance during beta testing!
-OPERATIONAL HINT: With the addition of multi-satellite tracking, the 
Motion Map feature now really comes into its own; press "M" when the normal 
map is displayed to switch to the EGA Motion Map, press "M" or ENTER to 
return to normal map or to the Main Menu. All satellites are updated as 
fast as the computer can draw the map. See the notes on a "vanilla" boot 
without memory managers for dedicated STSPLUS uses.
-The format of file STSPLUS.INI has been substantially modified and files 
from prior versions of STSPLUS will be ignored. The configuration 
information must therefore be re-entered.
-Increased to sixteen the number of additional TDRS and real time satellite 
positions in file STSPLUS.INI so that all active satellites may be updated 
and displayed. Sample data are shown below. See the section "TDRS and Real 
Time Satellite Features" for additional information.

     19883,"TDRE ", -0.04218, -41.14169,10014
     21639,"TDRW ", -0.03643,-174.14074,10014
     22314,"TDR5 ", -0.31155,-138.36021,10004
     19548,"TDR2 ",  0.05352, -61.66467,10004
     13969,"TDR1 ", -6.59117,-170.55876,10004
     16609,"MIR  ",-17.45706,-178.73251,14115

-TLEs for each active satellite are now saved in the .INI file so that 
accurate positions may be calculated dynamically. These TLEs should be 
updated periodically.
-TLEs may now also be saved in and read from special .SCF (Satellite 
Configuration File) files so that multiple TDRS and Real Time satellite 
configurations may be saved and/or selected. A sample file, STSPLUS.SCF is 
included in the standard distribution. Function Key F6 from the Main Menu 
is used to display, modify, save, or read these data.
-The 5-character abbreviation of each TDRS satellite may now be used to 
label the satellite. The size and color of the icon used to display each 
TDRS or real time satellite may now be independently controlled.
-STSPLUS now uses the calculated LATITUDE for the display of all TDRS 
satellites. This will cause TDRS1, for example, to appear up to 7 degrees 
North or South of the Equator (as of 8/9/93).
-The drive, path, and name of the .CTY file may now be set with F7 from the 
Main Menu.
-The Motion Map is now available for the World Map in rectangular Šprojection. This is helpful with multiple real time satellites.
-Repaired an infrequent bug discovered by Joel Runes which causes the 
orthographic map to be redrawn continuously when a) the satellite has a 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 225


high eccentricity (.73 in the test case), and b) when the map is being 
drawn at approximately the time of perigee. The code has been modified to 
take the Eccentricity into account in calculating the map offset time.
-Corrected a minor bug which caused MET in excess of 9999 days to overflow 
the assigned format statement for the data block and appear as 
"%12038/00:00:00 MET" with the "MET" wrapping around to the left side of 
the screen. Obviously, there aren't many satellites with this problem, but 
NORAD #00051 is one such. The STSPLUS.LTD entry for this satellite is:

     00051,2437158.90208333,0

and the problem was noted because of the pre-launch "temporary" NORAD 
number assignment for STS-51.
-A similar problem occurred with the large clock displays. In both 
projection modes, only the last four days of MET are now displayed (12038 
days will display as "2038").
-Added a reminder in the text that when entering filenames using F7 from 
the Main Menu, a drive and path may also be included if desired. That 
capability has been present for some time but was not stated explicitly.
-Changed the precision that the "plain English" display of the elements 
Epoch Time is displayed for approval (F2 from the Main Menu) from [rounded] 
integer seconds to 0.001 seconds, coordinated with VEC2TLE V9331.
-Several V9332 Beta Versions were released privately for testing.


Version 9331 -- July 1993
-------------------------
-In coordination with Ken Ernandes' VEC2TLE, the data output for Format 7,
ECI State Vector (Labeled Data), has been modified. The data have been 
supplemented by the addition of two lines: Element Set Number; and, Rev 
Number at Epoch. The International Designation has been added to the 
Catalog Number line and the Epoch Time is now given to .001 seconds. The 
data output for Format 4 has been changed so that it is identical to Format 
7. See text for details.
-Per Ken Ernandes, the Format 4 & 7 label "Ndot/3" is changed to "Nndot/6".
-I have received NO REPORTS from anyone using Data Formats 5 and 6. Those 
formats may not continue to be supported indefinitely UNLESS I am informed 
of applications which use them.

     CAUTION: STSPLUS Version 9331 Data Formats 4 and 7 are NOT compatible 
     with VEC2TLE Version 9322 when multiple state vectors are generated! 
     Use a release of VEC2TLE with a version number equal to or greater 
     than 9331. (However, manually editing the data to remove the Elset and 
     Rev Number lines can restore compatibility with the older version.)

     NOTE: Users are urged to update to VEC2TLE Version 9331 or the current 
     version, which ever is later! Not only does the current version of 
     VEC2TLE maintain compatibility with STSPLUS but several important new 
     features have been added and a bug in Version 9322 which affected data 
     accuracy under certain circumstances has been repaired.

-The Tracking Station Mode is now active in both Orthographic and ŠRectangular projections. The projection used will be the same as the one 
which is active when the "T" key is pressed.
-Repaired a bug which caused the NORAD number displayed in the Pass 
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 226


Prediction Mode to be incorrect under certain circumstances. Thanks to 
Grant Pinto!
-Repaired a bug in the pass prediction logic which caused the MAX 
VISIBILITY data to be misstated by a significant amount for certain 
satellites, especially ones with higher eccentricities. Thanks to Grant 
Pinto for spotting and reporting the bug!
-Changed the default time zone abbreviation for unrecognized (foreign) time 
zones from all spaces (which confused the Pass Prediction setup!) to "LCL".
-Corrected a bug using F2 from the Main Menu which showed no 2-line 
elements files if no .TXT files were found in the current directory but one 
or more .TLE files were present. Thanks to Bob Krohn for reporting the bug. 
If no files of either filetype are found, an error is displayed and the 
user is returned to the Main Menu.
-Corrected a bug in default paths if the root directory was used. (Path 
defaulted to "B:\\" instead of "B:\" for drive B:, etc.)
-Corrected a bug in the NORAD number for F2 from the Main Menu. If the 
NORAD number was greater than 32767, a negative number was shown.
-Disabled RIGHTIME detection for 8086/8088 processors. The detection 
process affected the time in certain XT-class machines.
-Corrected a minor bug which caused the "blink" feature for the satellite 
icon not to function under certain circumstances.
-Corrected a minor bug which initialized the Location Flag incorrectly for 
CGA systems when file STSPLUS.INI was not present. Locations and Features 
were displayed even though the menu display indicated they were OFF.
-Various cosmetic changes.
-Most of the changes in this release were included in Beta Version 9329.


Version 9320 -- May 1993
------------------------
-This is a MAJOR UPGRADE, adding new improvements and features along with 
high precision state vector data output for use with Ken Ernandes' program 
VEC2TLE.
-By popular request, STSPLUS now estimates if a satellite may be visible to 
the naked eye or binoculars, and displays "VIS" in bright white next to the 
orbit inclination if a visual sighting may be possible. See the section 
"Satellite Visibility" for additional discussion.
-Also by popular request, the pass predictions (F3, Data Mode 9) have been 
enhanced to permit dates and times to be displayed for either UTC/GMT or 
LOCAL time. An additional prompt has been added for that selection.
-When displaying predicted passes (F3, Data Mode 9), the satellite is now 
approximately centered in the display (instead of being well to one side).
-After considerable confusion and several user comments, I have reworked 
the pass prediction logic so that when the user returns to the Main Menu 
after the ground track for a predicted pass is displayed, the time is 
automatically restored to the real or simulated time in effect BEFORE the 
pass prediction was displayed. This means that repeated use of the pass 
prediction feature will generally display the same list of numbered passes 
and the user no longer needs to restore real time (or reset simulated time) 
after displaying predicted passes.
-Corrected a cosmetic bug on pass predictions when an illegal pass number 
(greater than the last pass number displayed) was entered at the prompt.Š-Added an asterisk ("*") at the left of each event timer when the satellite 
is AOS (signal/Sun is being received). This will particularly benefit users 
with monochrome or shades of gray.
Program STSORBIT PLUS Satellite Orbit Simulation                   Page 227


-Enhanced the Precision X-Y-Z State Vector Data Modes (F3, Data Modes 4 
through 7) to include four output formats: multi-line Ascending Node with 
state vector, 2 numeric data lines, comma delimited, and multi-line labeled 
data. State vectors may now be logged continuously, for a specific time, or 
for a specified time span. See text for details.
-Corrected a problem with state vectors being generated at the wrong time 
(Data Modes 5 through 7) when the time was entered in UTC and local time 
was a different date.
-Removed the low precision state vector data output (F3, Data Mode 4).
-Changed the angle used to calculate the Earth's partial penumbra from 1.2 
degrees to 0.3 degrees to better correspond with observed lighting. The Sun 
AOS and LOS penumbral calculations were also slightly adjusted; timings 
during STS-56 indicated about a 15 to 20 second error before these changes.
-Updated the TDRS information in the section "TDRS Satellite Features" and 
all five TDRS satellites are now displayed on the maps at their approximate 
locations as of 05/05/93. Thanks to Jim Walls for reminding me!
-Corrected a bug which caused "BASIC Error = 5" when the selected satellite 
had probably decayed. #22209 MIR Debris was an example in file TLE180.TXT. 
STSPLUS now displays a warning message if the satellite has a current 
altitude less than 75 nautical miles and then returns to the Main Menu.
-Corrected the conversion from kilometers to feet per Ken Ernandes. (My 
original conversion factor was taken from a 40+ year old Handbook of 
Chemistry and Physics and was very slightly in error!)
-Repaired (I think...) a truncation problem which sometimes caused MET/T+E 
to run one second slow.
-For all those who refuse to read documentation, I added a reminder to the 
Main Menu: "WHILE MAP IS DISPLAYED: F1 = HELP, ENTER = Main Menu".
-Special thanks to Ken Ernandes, Joel Runes, and Willie Musty for state 
vectors, testing, and validation of the new features in recent versions!
-Version 9319 was released privately for beta testing.


(Intermediate update notes deleted to save space.)


Beta Version 9137 -- September, 1991
