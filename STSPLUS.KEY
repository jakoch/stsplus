ACTIVE KEYS DURING GROUND TRACK DISPLAY
---------------------------------------

     The following table lists the various keys which are active when the 
ground track display is shown on the screen. Some of these features are 
more fully described elsewhere.

   ENTER  Return to Main Menu (cancel the simulation).

      F1  On-line HELP. Press F1 to display a help screen in the lower 
          portion of the screen. Press F1 again to resume normal data 
          display.

      F2  Selects the Big Clock mode. These modes are selected in the 
          following order:

               0    No clock displayed
               1    UTC date and time
               2    Local date and time
               3    STN/TDRS AOS/LOS and MET or T+Epoch (select with F5)

          Note that not all computers (especially older CGA systems) will 
          display the extended graphics characters used for the large clock 
          characters. The symptom of this problem is that the lower left 
          portion of the data block is mostly blank after pressing F2. If 
          you have this problem and your computer is running DOS 3.x or DOS 
          5.0, enter the command "GRAFTABL" at the DOS prompt before 
          running STSPLUS or include the line "GRAFTABL" in your 
          AUTOEXEC.BAT file; this sets the "code page" to enable the 
          computer to display the extended graphics characters. [The 
          program GRAFTABL.COM is included as part of DOS in most cases.]

      F3  Enable or disable printer logging. If logging is enabled, the 
          word LOG appears in the lower right of the screen. Be sure the 
          printer is turned on BEFORE using the F3 command. The F3 command 
          automatically enables the display of ascending and descending 
          node information.

      F4  Toggle FAST mode from x1 to x10 to x60 to x1, etc. When either of 
          the fast modes is enabled, "(x10)" or "(x60)" will appear at the 
          upper left of the screen in red. This feature operates in both 
          the normal (real or simulated time) and PAUSE modes.

      F5  Switches the elapsed time between "T+Epoch" and "MET". If no 
          launch time and date have been entered, this command will have no 
          effect.

      F6  Enable PAUSE mode. The plot is frozen at the current position and 
          the "+" and "-" keys are enabled. The "=" key may be used instead 
          of the "+" key to avoid use of the SHIFT KEY. Press ENTER to 
          resume normal operation using the current simulated time. (NOTE: 
          To return to REAL TIME after the PAUSE mode, press ENTER after 
          leaving PAUSE to return to the Main Menu, then press F8+F1.)

      F7  Enable or disable the spacecraft circle of visibility.

      F8  Switches program operation between NORMAL and DOPPLER SHIFT 
          modes. (Orthographic projection only; see text for details.)

      F9  Change units of distance between kilometers (km), nautical miles 
          (nm), and statute miles (sm).

     F10  Change satellite coordinates between Altitude/Elevation and 
          Azimuth (Topocentric) in either NORMAL or COMPLEMENTARY mode (see 
          the notes under Set Satellite Coordinates for details), Right 
          Ascension and Declination (Equatorial), and X-Y-Z (Geocentric 
          Rectangular, also known as ECI or Earth-Centered Inertial) 
          coordinate systems. If a Target Satellite has been selected, F10 
          may also be used to display Relative Range and Velocity between 
          the Primary and Target Satellites. See the section "Normal and 
          Complementary Azimuth/Elevation Tracking" for further details.

     F11  (WINDOWS 95/98 ONLY) Activate program STSUPDAT to update all TLEs 
          currently in use by STSPLUS. Requires an active Internet 
          connection prior to execution of STSPLUS. Pressing CTRL-F2 also 
          invokes program STSUPDAT in a slightly different mode. See the 
          section "Using STSPLUS with program STSUPDAT by Greg Swift" for 
          additional information.

     F12  Select units of display for AOS and LOS. Cycles through countdown 
          clocks, UTC time, local time, and MET. If launch time has not 
          been set, MET AOS/LOS times will NOT be available.

       *  Write STSPLUS.PCX image file of current tracking map. Available 
          only for VGA and EGA display adapters. (See also Maim Menu, "F4 
          Enable/Disable PCX Image File Generation", for additional 
          discussion.)

     +/=  During PAUSE mode only, "+" moves the satellite to the NEXT 
          calculated position based upon the FAST mode then in effect: 
          simulated time is advanced 1, 10, or 60 seconds. The "=" key may 
          be used instead of "+" to avoid use of the SHIFT KEY.

       -  During PAUSE mode only, "-" moves the satellite to the PREVIOUS 
          calculated position based upon the FAST mode then in effect: 
          simulated time is backed up 1, 10, or 60 seconds.

     TAB  In rectangular map modes only, enable or disable automatic map 
          generation. Automatic map generation is ALWAYS enabled in 
          orthographic modes. When automatic map generation is enabled in 
          rectangular map modes, the letter "A" will appear in the upper 
          right of the display screen. Pressing the TAB key will always 
          cause the map to be redrawn.

    PgUp  NORMAL OPERATION: When in one of the zoom modes, increases the 
          field of view (decreases MAG) up to a maximum of 180 degrees. 
          Press rapidly to execute multiple zoom steps without redrawing 
          the map for each keypress.

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Increases the "RECV" frequency by 1 KHz. Hold 
          down or press rapidly for large frequency changes.

    PgDn  NORMAL OPERATION: When in one of the zoom modes, decreases the 
          field of view (increases MAG) down to a minimum of 30 degrees. 
          Press rapidly to execute multiple zoom steps without redrawing 
          the map for each keypress.

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Decreases the "RECV" frequency by 1 KHz. Hold 
          down or press rapidly for large frequency changes.

    Home  NORMAL OPERATION: When in one of the zoom modes, returns the 
          field of view to 75 degrees (rectangular projections) or the full 
          globe (orthographic projections).

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Restores the UpLink and DnLink center 
          frequencies to the original values read from file STSPLUS.FRQ.

     End  NORMAL OPERATION: When in one of the zoom modes, returns the 
          field of view to the last zoom factor used prior to pressing the 
          HOME key.

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: (not used and inactive)

      UP  NORMAL OPERATION: (not used and inactive)

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Increases the "RECV" frequency by 100 Hz. 
          Hold down or press rapidly for larger frequency changes.

    DOWN  NORMAL OPERATION: (not used and inactive)

          DOPPLER SHIFT MODE: Decreases the "RECV" frequency by 100 Hz. 
          Hold down or press rapidly for larger frequency changes.
          
       B  Toggle the BLINK mode of the satellite symbol between blinking 
          and steady. NOTE: On most systems, the satellite symbol will 
          appear to blink very briefly as it is erased and redrawn even 
          when BLINK is OFF.

       O  Select Orthographic Projection (the LETTER "O" not the digit 
          zero). PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End are active to select the 
          magnification.

     W,0  Select World Map display, showing the full world from +85 degrees 
          North latitude to -85 degrees South latitude using rectangular 
          projection. If automatic map generation is disabled, pressing "W" 
          or "0" will toggle between the two world map displays.

       Q  Select Quadrant Map display, showing 180 degrees field of view 
          (rectangular projection) and selected so as to approximately 
          center the satellite.

      1-9 Select the indicated Quadrant Map. Automatic map generation is 
      !@# disabled when a specific quadrant map is selected. See the chart
          in the section Quadrant Maps for the map numbers.

       Z  Select Zoom Map display, showing from 180 to 30 degrees field of 
          view (rectangular projection) and selected so as to approximately 
          center the satellite. The default is 75 degrees.

       L  Select Location Map display, showing concentric isocontours for 
          your location. If a second location has been enabled, press "L" 
          again for that location.

          When the Location Map is displayed in orthographic projection, 
          the slash key "(/") may be used to enable user specified map 
          center. See the section Location Map with Specified Map Center 
          for additional information.

       T  Tracking Station Map display, showing concentric isocontours for 
          the tracking station closest to the current ground track position 
          of the satellite using the current projection. Uses the data in 
          the current TRACKING STATION file to select the tracking 
          station(s); if the file is not found, STSPLUS defaults to an 
          internal set of tracking stations. Use F7 from the Main Menu to 
          select the TRACKING STATION filename.

       M  Satellite Motion Map display, available on EGA and VGA systems 
          only. Displays a map with the satellite centered using the map 
          projection in effect when the key is pressed. In rectangular 
          modes, the map is shown in zoom. Maps are drawn "off screen" and 
          a complete map is always displayed. The map is updated every 10 
          seconds or as rapidly as the computer processor will permit. 
          While the Satellite Motion Map is displayed, the following keys 
          are active: ENTER, "M", "Home", "End", "PgUp", and "PgDn"; these 
          keys perform the same functions as during the normal display 
          except that the "M" key cancels the Satellite Motion Map and 
          returns to normal display.

       R  Redraw the map without returning to the Main Menu. This 
          immediately redraws the map (if it becomes cluttered or if the 
          user wishes to reposition the primary satellite). As an 
          incidental benefit of this method of redrawing, the Ascending and 
          Descending Node data is preserved when that feature is enabled.

  ALT-F1  Display orbital data for primary or secondary satellites.

  ALT-F2  Execute program GPSSYNC to determine/set current time and date 
          and to determine the current position (latitude, longutude, and 
          elevation). Requires program GPSSYNC, available for download from 
          my home page.

   ALT-R  Enable/Disable "Night Vision" mode. In "Night Vision" mode, all 
          screen colors are changed to either RED or LIGHT RED to protect 
          night vision adaptation. (ALT-R also operates at the Main Menu.)
