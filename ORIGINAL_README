REGISTRATION AND DONATIONS
--------------------------
Registration of STSORBIT PLUS is optional but strongly encouraged. I've
spent thousands of hours on the program and make it and my Internet Home
Page available as a public service. The modest donation will help
inspire me to continue improving the program and help offset the costs of
mailing, software development, and my Internet Home Page. As a bonus for
your registration, I will mail the current version on disk which includes
the Level 3 and Level 4 map databases. Registration requires a minimum
donation of US$15.00 but you are invited to donate whatever you feel the
program is worth! This has turned out to be an expensive "hobby"! Credit
cards and foreign currencies are NOT accepted. Checks must be drawn on a
US bank and denominated in US dollars.

Registration of STSORBIT PLUS includes program STSICON, used to create and
modify satellite icons for use with Version 9517 and above.

Please allow 3 to 6 weeks for delivery.

     _____  No disk desired (for users who download the files and/or are
            making an additional donation to continue support for STSORBIT
            PLUS and my Internet Home Page)

     _____  3-1/2" 1.44MB disk  

            DONATION (US$15.00 minimum):                 US$____________

ADDITIONAL MAP DATABASE FILES
-----------------------------
Most users will probably be satisfied with the Level 3 map database files
which are available for download and are included with normal registration.
However, for users who plan on using higher zoom factors and wish substan-
tially better map detail, two sets of higher detail map database files are
available: Level 1 (highest detail) and Level 2 (next highest detail). The
higher level map databases will be automatically selected for higher zoom
factors if present. Map drawing times are longer with higher detail map
database files!

REGISTERED USERS may obtain the additional map database files separately
on disk for an additional donation of US$10.00 EACH. Credit cards and
foreign currencies are NOT accepted. Checks must be drawn on a US bank and
denominated in US dollars.

ONLY 3-1/2" 1.44MB disks are available. Files are supplied in compressed,
self-extracting .EXE format.
